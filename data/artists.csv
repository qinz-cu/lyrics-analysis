                                        Alternative rock band formed in Leeds, England in 1995 by brothers Jason Perry, Adam Perry and Giles Perry alongside Mark Chapman and Stevie Swindon.

A were originally called 'Grand Designs', but abandoned this name before signing with Warner Bros. Records in 1996. They released their first album 'How Ace Are Buildings' in 1997. After this, bassist Stevie Swindon left and was replaced by Daniel P. Carter (current host of BBC1's Rock Show). 

A licensing agreement for the U.S. and Canada was reached with mammoth Records. Their second album ''A' Vs. Monkey Kong' was released in 1999 and followed by a live album 'Exit Stage Right' in 2000. Their third album, 'Hi-Fi Serious' was released in 2002.

Their fourth album 'Teen Dance Ordinance' was recorded in 2003 but due to the illness of Jason Perry and disputes with the record company it's release was delayed until 2005. This album features a straighter rock sound and the keyboards and samples that were present on the earlier albums are almostly completely absent. Hollywood Records had agreed to release this album in the states but eventually decided against doing so.

After the release of 'Teen Dance Ordinance' the band have been on hiatus and the members have been working on other projects. In 2008 the band announced that they were back in the studio working on new material and have since began touring again.

Line-up:

Johnny Abdullah (Bass)
Jon Kelley (Drums)
Torry Jasper (Guitar & Vocals)

Bio:

A Change of Pace formed in 2001 when singer Torry Jasper and drummer Jonathan Kelly began playing together in freshmen year of high school (while attending Centennial High School). In 2003, after a few years of jamming and playing small local shows, bassist Johnny Abdullah and guitarist Adam Rodgers joined the band. From there they were discovered by manager Jorge Hernandez, and within a few months they had a deal with Immortal Records and released their EP Change Is The Only Constant.

In 2005 the band released their first full-length album, An Offer You Can't Refuse, and landed a spot on the Vans Warped Tour. Just a year after their first album, on August 15 A Change of Pace released their second record, Prepare The Masses. The band also added a fifth member to the band, Dan Parker (previously in Don't Let Go).

On June 1, 2008 the band announced that they had parted ways with former vocalist Torry Jasper, and announced a new lead singer, Micah Bentley. They also announced the release of their EP, Just No Better Way. With new singer Micah Bentley they have adopted a lighter tone to their music, contrasting drastically with their previous singer Torry Jasper who screamed vocals in the older material.

The new album, entitled It Could Be Worse was released on February 22.[1]

In 2011, Micah Bentley married Ashley Bentley. Bentley currently lives with his wife in Peoria, Arizona where he continues to write music for his new project. This new project is called ""Micah and His Friend"".

a-day-to-remember,"
                                        A Day To Remember is an American band from Ocala, Florida, founded in the spring of 2003 by guitarist Tom Denney and drummer Bobby Scruggs. They are known for their unusual amalgamation of metalcore and pop punk. The band currently consists of vocalist Jeremy McKinnon, rhythm guitarist Neil Westfall, bassist Joshua Woodard, percussionist/drummer Alex Shelnutt and lead guitarist Kevin Skaff.

                                        A Fine Frenzy is the music of Alison Sudol (born December 23, 1984, Seattle, WA, USA).

Born to dramatic-arts teacher parents, Alison moved to Los Angeles at the age five. With her newly single mother, Alison moved frequently around the city. She developed a strong love for the fantastic literary worlds of CS Lewis, EB White, Lewis Carroll and Charles Dickens, while becoming a passionate author in her own right.

Alison also immersed herself in classical music, Motown, Aretha Franklin, swing bands, Ella Fitzgerald, Elton John, Louis Armstrong, the Beatles, Technicolor movies and classic 1950's television.

After teaching herself to play piano, Alison increasingly invested her internal narratives into song form. She found solace in the melodic melancholia of new global British bands Aqualung, Radiohead, Coldplay and Keane, etc... She was also moved by the diatonic minimalism of Philip Glass and the transportive allure of Icelandic music (Bjork, Sigur Ros.) Inspired, Alison developed the sound of A Fine Frenzy - hypnotic piano arrangements under classic American melody fused into irresistible, atmospheric songs with the power to reach around the world.

                                        Formed : 1979 in Liverpool, United Kingdom 
Members: 
Mike Score (vocals, keyboards)
Paul Reynolds (guitar 1980-84)
Ali Score (drums 1980-86)
Frank Maudsley (bass 1980-86)
Chris Chryssaphis (keyboards on 'Dream Come True' tour '86), Gary Steadnin (guitar on 'Dream Come True' tour '86)
Dean Pichette (bass 1995), A.J. Mazzetti (drums 1995), Ed Berner (guitar 1995)
Joe Rodriguez (guitar 1998- )
Albert Cruz (drums), Robbie 'Sinn' Hanson (bass) 

A FLOCK OF SEAGULLS was started by Mike Score and his brother Ali in 1979 in Liverpool. 

Mike, who was previously a hairdresser, played keyboards, guitar, and vocals, Ali played drums and their friend Frank Maudsley played bass. 
The band took their name from a line in the song ""Toiler on the Sea"" by The Stranglers, which appears on their album 'Black And White'. 
The band added guitarist Willie Woo, and Mark Edmondson joined briefly when Ali and Mike had a falling out; however, Ali re-joined when Mark took ill. They then began writing songs. 

Soon after, Willie left, allowing Paul Reynolds to join. They then started playing clubs and eventually got a recording contract.

Eventually, under the management of Tommy Crossan and Mick Rossi (Checkmount Ltd.), they began to release singles through Jive Records. 
The group released an EP and a couple of singles, 'Its Not Me Talking' and 'Telecommunication' on Bill Nelson's 'Cocteau' label; both tracks produced by Nelson. 

In 1982 the group's third single ""I Ran (So Far Away)"" became a worldwide hit, most notably reaching number 1 in Australia and the top 10 in the US and New Zealand. The parent album A Flock of Seagulls and another single ""Space Age Love Song"" were also successful. 

In late 1982 the band found major success in their home country with ""Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)"" (first single from their next album) which reached the top 10. 

As it turned out, 1982 would prove to be the peak year of their commercial and critical success. 

1983 saw the release of three singles to back their second album Listen. 
Each was only a minor success in the UK and abroad. The album bore a heavily processed electronic sound that was a break from the Duran Duran guitar and bass driven sound of their d√©but. 

The group produced a third album in 1984 that leant closer to a guitar sound. 

""The More You Live, The More You Love"" was The Story of a Young Heart's lead single. It was moderately successful, despite having production that recalled their breakout hit ""I Ran"". The album's other two singles - ""Never Again (The Dancer)"" and ""Remember David"" - didn't make any headway.

Faced with sliding sales and a loss of direction following the third album the group relocated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania minus Paul Reynolds. 
Eventually in 1985 the group released a new album; Dream Come True. Despite having a new sound based around the Fairlight Synthesizer the album was critically panned and a commercial failure. 

The remaining members fell out and A Flock Of Seagulls in its original incarnation disbanded. In promotion of Dream Come True, two videos - ""Who's That Girl"" and ""Heartbeat Like a Drum"" - were filmed in quick succession. 

These two videos were the last time the three remaining members were together in a recording or performance capacity until 2004.

In November 2003, the original line-up (Mike and Ali Score, Paul Reynolds and Frank Maudsley) reunited for a one-off performance on the VH1 series, Bands Reunited. 

In September 2004, they reformed again and played a small number of live shows in the United States, but broke up immediately afterward.

Internationally successful Swedish pop group, active from 1972 until 1983. The most commercially successful artists of the 1970s, their biggest hits include Dancing Queen, Fernando, Waterloo, Chiquitita, Mamma Mia, and Take A Chance On Me. Sales figures for the group are widely varying, with the official estimate at 370 million records.

Their music has seen a resurgence in interest in part due to the release of their multi-platinum greatest hits album ""ABBA Gold"" in 1992 and a general revival in interest in disco and '70s music around the same time. Their music gained even greater visibility with the jukebox musical ""Mamma Mia!"" based on their hits, which opened in 1999 and is still running in venues around the world.

ABBA were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2010 in the category of performer.

ace-frehley,"
                                        Born: April 27, 1951, Bronx, New York

Paul Daniel ""Ace"" Frehley (pronounced /?fre?li/) is an American musician best known as an original lead guitarist of the rock band Kiss. He took on the persona of the ""Spaceman"" or ""Space Ace"" when the band adopted costumes and theatrics. Frehley played with the group from its inception in 1973 until his departure in 1982.

After leaving Kiss, Frehley embarked on a solo career, which was put on hold when he rejoined Kiss in 1996 for a highly successful reunion tour. His second tenure with Kiss lasted until 2002, when he left at the conclusion of what was purported to be the band's Farewell Tour. His latest album, Origins vol.1, was released in April 2016.

Frehley was born and raised in The Bronx, the youngest of three children. He has a sister Nancy and a brother Charles, a classical guitarist. As a youth, Frehley was in a New York street gang called The Duckies with Steven Edward Duren (aka Blackie Lawless, who would later become frontman for heavy metal band W.A.S.P.). The Frehleys were a musical family, and when Frehley received an electric guitar as a Christmas present in 1964, he immersed himself in learning the instrument. ""I never went to music school; I never took a guitar lesson, but everybody in my family plays an instrument. My mother and father both played piano, his father was the church organist, and my brother and sister both played piano and acoustic guitar."" Frehley was always surrounded by music. Frehley started playing guitar at age 13. He lists Jimi Hendrix, Albert Lee, Buddy Guy, Eric Clapton, B.B. King, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, and The Who as his main influences.

Frehley did well in the arts department in high school. Later in 1993, he would use his graphic arts skills to produce art work from a computer and sell the work in an art gallery in New Jersey.

Frehley spent the early 1970s in a series of local bands including prog rockers Molimo who recorded an album for RCA in 1971. In late 1972, his best friend, Bob McAdams (co-author of the book Kiss & Tell), spotted an advertisement for a lead guitarist in the Village Voice and showed the ad to Frehley. Both McAdams and Frehley went to 10 East 23rd Street above the Live Bait Bar. Frehley auditioned for Wicked Lester members Paul Stanley (rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (bass guitar) and Peter Criss (drums). Frehley, who showed up wearing one red sneaker and one orange sneaker, was less than impressive visually, but the band liked what they heard from his playing. About three weeks after Frehley auditioned, the new group named him their lead guitarist. By January 1973, Wicked Lester decided on a new name - Kiss. Frehley designed the band's double-lightning-bolt logo. The band quickly decided to paint their faces for live performances, and Frehley decided to start painting silver stars on his eyes.

While Kiss spent their early days rehearsing and playing in empty clubs, Frehley took a job as a part-time cab driver to pay his bills. In September 1973, Kiss began to receive a salary from new manager Bill Aucoin that paid each member $75 a week. This enabled Frehley to quit his job.

Kiss released their debut album, Kiss, in February 1974‚ÄîFrehley's sole songwriting contribution was ""Cold Gin"". Due to Frehley's lack of confidence in his own singing voice, however, the vocals were performed by Simmons. Frehley wrote or co-wrote several of the band's songs over the next few years but didn't record his vocals on a song until ""Shock Me"" (inspired by his near-electrocution during a concert in Lakeland, Florida), which appeared on 1977's Love Gun.

As lead guitarist, Frehley was known for his frenetic, atmospheric playing, becoming one of the most popular guitarists in the 70s and spawning a generation of new players. Frehley stated in the book Kiss: Behind the Mask that many guitarists have told him his playing on 1975's hit Alive! prompted them to pick up the instrument. Frehley is well recognized for using Gibson Les Paul guitars, including his trademarked model conversion Cara Guitars which filled the stage full of smoke during his live guitar solo.

Along with the three other Kiss members, Frehley released an eponymous solo album in 1978. His was the best-selling of the four, and the album's lone single ‚Äî the Russ Ballard-written ""New York Groove""), originally recorded by Hello ‚Äî reached the Top 20 in the United States.

Frehley's songwriting presence within the group increased in 1979. He contributed three songs for 1979's Dynasty and three for 1980's Unmasked. While this was not the best time for Kiss on a commercial level in the United States, they were only just beginning to take off in other countries (mostly in Australia, where Dynasty and Unmasked are their highest-selling albums). But even as his songwriting role within Kiss was increasing, Frehley found himself increasingly at odds with the musical direction of the band. After Peter Criss left Kiss in 1980, Frehley was often outvoted 2-1 in band decisions, as replacement drummer Eric Carr was not a partner in Kiss and had no vote. Frehley's participation in the recording of 1981's Music from ""The Elder"" was far more limited than with previous albums. This was in large part due to his unhappiness with the band's decision to create a concept album rather than a straightforward rock album, and also, by Frehley's own admission, his ""not relating all that well"" to producer Bob Ezrin, who cut many of Frehley's solos from the recorded tracks.

Although Frehley appeared on the covers for 1982's greatest hits album Killers and studio album Creatures of the Night, he had no involvement with Killers, and minimal (no musical) input on Creatures of the Night. Frehley's last appearances with the band were the video for ""I Love it Loud,"" a series of European promotional appearances in November 1982 and a band interview with MTV in early 1983 promoting their world tour.

In 1984, Frehley started his post-Kiss solo career by assembling a band that included, among others, drummer Anton Fig (who had performed on Frehley's 1978 solo album and on two Kiss albums). Bassist John Regan (who had worked with Peter Frampton), whom Frehley met in 1980, was also an original member of the band as was vocalist/guitarist Richie Scarlet and keyboardist Arthur Stead. The group, whose name alternated between 'Ace Frehley' and Frehley's Comet, recorded a series of demos throughout 1984 and 1985. After a few unsuccessful attempts at securing a recording contract, the group eventually signed to Megaforce Records and released their first album, Frehley's Comet, on July 7, 1987. The album was co-produced by Eddie Kramer, who had produced not only a number of Kiss albums, but Frehley's 1978 album and some of his 1984-85 demos.

Their style, which is rooted in blues-based hard rock, has come to also incorporate elements of pop rock, heavy metal, and rhythm and blues, and has inspired many subsequent rock artists. They were formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1970.

Joseph Foreman, better known by his stage name Afroman, is a Grammy nominated American comedy rapper who came to prominence with his singles ""Because I Got High"" and ""Crazy Rap"". Initially unknown when beginning his career, his song ""Because I Got High"" circulated around the Internet before becoming a hit worldwide. He was nominated for a Grammy award in 2002. He began rapping in the eighth grade, and in his church he played drums and guitar. For a short time, he worked as a baggage handler at an airport. 
In 1999, he released his first album, Sell Your Dope; he later relocated to Hattiesburg, Mississippi, where he met drummer Jody Stallone and keyboardist/bassist Daryl Havard. He released his second album Because I Got High (album) in 2000; it initially was distributed primarily through concerts and the file-sharing service Napster before its title track was played on The Howard Stern Show. Afroman based the song's lyrical content on his inability to clean his room; the lyrics outline that drug use affected his ability to do basic everyday life tasks. In late 2001, the song became a worldwide hit and was featured in the films Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, The Perfect Score, and Disturbia later in the 2000s. Additionally, the song is still in the Top 10 on Billboard's ""Hot Ringtones"" category, having been on the charts for over 190 weeks. Because of the single's success, Afroman joined the lineup of Cypress Hill's fall festival Smoke Out with Deftones, Method Man, and others. Universal Records signed Afroman to a six-album deal; Universal released The Good Times in 2001, a compilation of Afroman's first two albums and some new tracks. ""Because I Got High"" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance in 2002.
Starting in 2004, Afroman released his music independently and mostly through the Internet. He recorded a comedy album that year, Jobe Bells, mocking traditional Christmas songs

She made her chart debut with her single, ""Mr. Saxobeat"", which was written and produced by both Marcel Prodan and Andrei Nemirschi. They have previously discovered her at a karaoke bar in 2009 and offered her a contract with their own label, Maan Records, through which Stan also released a promotional single titled ""Show Me The Way"" and her debut single, ""Lollipop (Param Pam Pam)"". ""Mr. Saxobeat"" quickly achieved commercial success in her native Romania and aboard, with it reaching the number one spot of the Romanian Top 100 and topping the record charts in nine other countries, including Germany, where it became the first Romanian song to top the chart since O-Zone's ""Dragostea din tei"" (2004). Worldwide, ""Mr. Saxobeat"" has brought total sales of over 10 million shipments. Stan's next single, ""Get Back (ASAP)"" reached number one in Slovakia and the top ten in Romania, Hungary, Finland and Czech Republic. Following this, Saxobeats was made available for purchase as her debut studio album to digital stores over the world, including the United States and Canada. It reached number 15 in Japan and sold over 68,000 copies in that country.

Following a violent incident between Stan and Marcel Prodan in 2013, Stan's last album under his label, Clich√© (Hush Hush), was released. It was a Japan-only reissue of Saxobeats with the addition of three songs intented for her then-untitled sophomore studio album, ""Clich√© (Hush Hush)"", ""All My People"" and Lemonade""; the latter one was successful in Italy. Subsequently, Stan signed a new record deal with Fonogram Records and made her second studio album, Unlocked, available for digital download on 27 August 2014. Six songs from the record were released as singles, while ""Dance"" peaked at number 25 on the Japan Hot 100. Another release off the album, ""Give Me Your Everything"", aroused controversy upon the release of its music video for a scene in which Stan is wearing a white robe with masonic symbols inscribed on its back. Critics named the clip ""her most bizarre video ever"". As of January 2015, Unlocked sold more than 17,000 shipments in Japan, where it peaked at number 21 on the Oricon Albums Chart.

alice-in-chains,"
                                        Alternative Rock (Modern Rock)  band formed in Seattle, Washington (USA).

The Seattle grunge movement of the late eighties spawned many a band, and Alice In Chains were one of the most well-known, as well as one of the more traditionally metal (more so than they are given credit for). Their crooning harmonic vocal style has been imitated by many bands over the last following decades, certainly enough to qualify them as an influential band. A well-publicized drug problems (mostly centering around Layne Staley) surfaced as early as the ""Dirt"" era, making it rather obvious that the band was probably not going to survive in the long term. 

Guitarist Jerry Cantrell embarked on a successful solo career. 

Vocalist Layne Staley was found dead in his apartment on April 19th, 2002. Willian DuVall replaced Staley on vocals when the the remainder of the band reunited in 2009.

Current lineup:
William DuVall - vocals.
Jerry Cantrell - guitars, vocals.
Sean Kinney - drums, percussion.
Mike Inez - bass, guitar.

alicia-keys,"
                                        Alicia Augello-Cook (born January 25, 1981 in Manhattan, New York, U.S.A.), better known by her stage name Alicia Keys, is an American recording artist, musician and actress. She was raised by a single mother in the Hell's Kitchen area of Manhattan in New York City. At age seven, Keys began to play classical music on the piano. She attended Professional Performing Arts School and graduated at 16 as valedictorian. She later attended Columbia University before dropping out to pursue her music career.

In 2000, Alicia Keys was the one out of the three first artists signed to Clive Davis' now-defunct label, J Records (along with Mario Barrett and Olivia); later released her debut album with the label that following year, having had previous record deals first with Columbia and then, Arista Records.

Keys' debut album, Songs in A Minor[/I], was a commercial success, selling over 12 million copies worldwide and peaking at #1 on the Billboard 200. She became the best-selling new artist and best-selling R&B artist of 2001. The album earned Keys five Grammy Awards in 2002, including Best New Artist and Song of the Year for ""Fallin'"". Her second studio album, The Diary of Alicia Keys, was released in 2003 and was also another success worldwide, selling eight million copies. The album garnered her the second album to peak at the top spot, pushing off JAY-Z's Black album, an additional four Grammy Awards in 2005. Later that year, she released her first live album, MTV Unplugged: Alicia Keys, which debuted at number one in the United States. She became the first female to have an MTV Unplugged album to debut at number one and the highest since Nirvana in 1994.

Keys made guest appearances on several television series in the following years, beginning with Charmed. She made her film debut in Smokin' Aces (with fellow co-star Common) and went on to appear in The Nanny Diaries in 2007. Her third studio album, As I Am, was released in the same year and sold six million copies worldwide, earning Keys an additional three Grammy Awards. The following year, she appeared in The Secret Life of Bees, which earned her a nomination at the NAACP Image Awards. She released her fourth album, The Element of Freedom, in December 2009, which became Keys' first chart-topping album in the United Kingdom, however, it was a commercial disappointment, debuting at #2 on both the Billboard 200 and Top R&B Albums chart behind Susan Boyle's I Dreamed a Dream and Mary J. Blige's Stronger with Each Tear, respectively. Throughout her career, Keys has won numerous awards and has sold over 30 million albums worldwide. Billboard magazine named her the top R&B artist of the 2000‚Äì2009 decade, establishing herself as one of the best-selling artists of her time.

During 2010, it was rumored that Keys was dating hip-hop musician Swizz Beatz, in which she later stated it was true. They wedded in March 2011 and had 3 children later on. On October 27, 2011, Alicia Keys received an e-mail from Sony Music Entertainment (J's parent label), informing that all four labels: J Records, Arista Records, Jive Records and LaFace Records, will all be shut down and merged altogether to re-form RCA Records. It means that all of the artists that were previously signed to the four defunct labels (including Keys herself, Chris Brown, R. Kelly, Kid Ink, D'Angelo, Pitbull, Pink, Usher, ASAP Rocky, Christina Aguilera, etc.) were either/all to be re-arranged to RCA or to leave Sony Music.

In late 2012, Alicia Keys released her first project for RCA since the Jive/J/Arista/LaFace shut-down mergers, Girl on Fire, which became her fourth album to debut at #1 on the Billboard 200 and helped garnered her successful album title single (later remixed featuring Nicki Minaj) and ""New Day"" (which, at first, featured 50 Cent and Dr. Dre, but was cut-off).

On June 25, 2014, Keys announced her Alicia Youth Foundation, which helps children with problems related to education and poverty.

In 2015, amid the most controversial event of the year and in music rivalry history, The 7 Rivalries in 7 Days, after Ja Rule vs. Chief Keef, Tamar Braxton vs. DeJ Loaf, Young Thug vs. J. Cole and Azealia Banks vs. Ciara, Alicia Keys (in Day 5 of the event) has ignited her first music feud in her career as an artist with female rapper Lil' Kim.

In 2016, Keys generated more controversy after grudging body images on women, which caused a feud with singer Teairra Mari; later that year, Keys released her sixth album, Here, which became another commercial disappointment in the singer's career.

They achieved success with their debut single ""A Horse With No Name"" which showcased their pop rock vocal harmony style. Further appearances in the singles charts followed with ""Ventura Highway"" and ""Tin Man"" along with album hits.
The band has seen various reincarnations as anything from a duo to a 7 piece outfit, with Dan Peek leaving in 1977 (although he did rejoin for a few live appearances).

                                        Also known as: ""Head Charge"" or ""AHC"".

An industrial metal band from Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.

On August 11th 2009 the band released information that they had disbanded.

On June 30, 2011, bassist Chad Hanks announced the band planned on rehearsing again and making more music. Furthermore, he advertised the band's official Facebook account ""American Head Charge (Official)"".

The five-song Shoot EP was self-released July 23, 2013 with a national tour starting two weeks later.

In March 2014, the band started an Indiegogo campaign to raise funds to finance the recording of their fourth studio album, the first full-length recording since 2005's ""The Feeding"". Dave Fortman had been tapped to produce the album. The band raised $53,370 exceeding the initial goal of $46,000. The band offered fans everything from downloads of new songs, pre-orders of the new album, signed gear and handwritten lyrics, VIP access to shows, name in the album credits, personal lessons, a chance to perform with the band and guestlist for life. One contributor donated to get the band to play their zombie themed wedding reception.

Following the success of the campaign, the band played multiple shows with Wayne Static and performed at the Download Festival in June 2014. Following the Download performance and a few dates in the UK, the band holed up in Kentucky at Third Sky Studios to record the long awaited full-length record.

In October 2014, the band accompanied Soil (band), Hed P.E. and Wolfborne on a tour across Europe and the UK. The band was set to go on a tour a week after returning to the states with Wolfborne and joining Wayne Static and Powerman 5000 for a multi city US tour. Due to the unfortunate passing of Wayne static on November 1, the bands regrouped and decided to soldier on with the tour in Wayne's memory.

After 6 months filled with recording and touring, the band took time off with a ""Holiday Hangover"" show on December 27 planned for Minneapolis' Turf Club. The band teased a big announcement for December 9 via Facebook. On December 9 the band confirmed a 2-month spring tour with Coal Chamber, Filter and Combichrist.

On March 25, 2016 their long awaited full album ""Tango Umbrella"" was released on Napalm Records

Themgoroth eventually left the band and was replaced by Johan Hegg which also resulted in a muscial change towards Death/Viking Metal. Anders Hansson (guitar) and Nico Mehra (drums) joined the band and they then finally changed name to Amon Amarth, which is taken from Tolkien's famous Lord of the Ring trilogy and means the mighty mountain of doom, in 1992. 

In 1993 the band entered Lagret Studio to record the never released demo, ""Thor Arise"". In March 1994 the band once again entered the same studio to record the demo ""Arrival of the Fimbul Winter"". Much more satisfied with the sound and production they released it. The 1000 copies quickly sold out and they even got a one-deal record with Singapore's Pulverised Records. In November 1995 the band entered Abyss Studio and recorded the MCD ""Sorrow Throughout the Nine Worlds"" and released it 1996. Shortly after their drummer Nico Mehra left the band but was replaced by Martin L√≥pez of Opeth. 

The band was signed to Metal Blade and once again they entered Abyss Studio to record their first full-length album ""Once Sent from the Golden Hall"". It was released in 1998. After this recording guitarist Anders Hansson was replaced by Johan S√∂derberg and a month later they went on a tour with Deicide, Six Feet Under and Brutal Truth. Mart√≠n L√≥pez then left the band and was replaced by Fredrik Andersson. In 1999 ""The Avenger"" was recorded and released. In November 2000 the band entered The Abyss Studio for the last time and recorded ""The Crusher"" and released it 2001. This release gave Amon Amarth the opportunity to tour a lot more and right after the recording they went on their first headlining tour through Denmark and Germany with Purgatory and Seirim. 

A lot of more tours followed and in 2002 ""Versus the World"" was recorded and released.

                                        Anaal Nathrakh was created for one purpose - to be the soundtrack for armageddon, the audial essence of evil, hatred and violence, the true spirit of necro taken to its musical extremes... 

In the beginning of 1999, Anaal Nathrakh recorded their first demo, ""Anaal Nathrakh"". Later the same year in September, another demo, ""Total Fucking Necro"", was produced. They made a deal with Leviaphonic Records and both demos were released on a disc titled ""Total Fucking Necro - Double Demo Assault"". The release was a hit in the underground. Never before had they heard such raw, brutal music before. Even the legendary Mayhem praised them after they had heard Anaal Nathrakh's cover of ""De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas"". 

The band's debut CD, ""The Codex Necro"", which was released in 2001, was voted best newcomer of 2001 and best album of the year in the magazine Terrorizer. Anaal Nathrakh's latest album, ""When Fire Rains Down From the Sky, Mankind Will Reap As It Has Sown"", followed in 2003. The EP featured the legendary Attila Csihar (Mayhem, Aborym, Tormentor) and Seth Teitan 131 (Aborym).

anarbor,"
                                        Pop Rock outfit from Phoenix, Arizona, formed in 2003.

(Originally named Troop 101)

Soulful, fresh, genre-defying. These are only a few of the terms that immediately spark the mind when greeted with Anarbor‚Äôs gutsy and transcending EP, Free Your Mind. When noted that the aforementioned genre is pop-rock, it seems even more special that a band with this talent and bravado would push itself away from a scene where predetermined trappings threaten to undermine its singular integrity.
‚ÄúWe know that every single kid out there is tired of the same old dance-pop record that gets released every single week. Our goal is to be the music scene‚Äôs saving grace,‚Äù says guitarist Mike Kitlas. ‚ÄúIt will tell our listeners that we are here to stay and we are not a fad band that will fade out as soon as dance-pop is outdated.‚Äù

Free Your Mind extends beyond the cut-and-paste albums being churned out, instead infusing dynamic guitars behind the soul-shaking howls and relatable melodies from frontman Slade Echeverria. Crafted in Los Angeles by producer Mike Green (Paramore, Good Charlotte) over a four-week span in Los Angeles, Free Your Mind's formation came from a desire to break out from the ""fad band"" chokehold and delve into what was real.
The EP's lyrical themes of drama-addled love are age-appropriate for this band still fresh from cap and gown status, yet show emerging maturity and growth while navigating the waters of life on the road and in the press, as well as their loss of anonymity. Not one track doesn‚Äôt contain a purpose or reason ripped from the band‚Äôs own personal headlines, and the EP title wasn‚Äôt without a conscious peek into their agenda, either.
‚ÄúWe want to challenge kids to think outside of the norm, and really find themselves, rather then just following what the crowd is doing,‚Äù Kitlas said. ‚ÄúWe want to show our listeners that they are not alone, we all go through our struggles and everyone has their ups and downs in life.‚Äù
The seven-track EP, kicks off with a mischievous call to a wayward paramour on ‚ÄúLet The Games Begin,‚Äù before sliding into the instant hip-shaking grooves of ‚ÄúThe Brightest Green,‚Äù a slice of Maroon 5-ish soul that takes on a life of its own. Anarbor takes a familiar formula but adds a warmth and genuineness to every guitar lick and lyric that keeps them relatable yet unique. Each track seamlessly follows the next, spinning clever lyrics and brisk guitars, and each adds another deft chapter to this memorable volume.

‚ÄúThe distinctive sound we are reaching for is rock and roll. We don't use any instruments in our songs that we don‚Äôt play live, we are going for a very raw and real sound for this record,‚Äù Kitlas said. When noted that shared influences range from Third Eye Blind to Red Hot Chili Peppers, it‚Äôs even more apparent where the EP‚Äôs driving and fully-executed rock-based energy gained its roots.
The easy nature and chemistry of the band from Phoenix, Arizona, formed in 2003 is more than just a cosmic luck for an emerging band. Because this, in years of formation, is by no means a freshman band. Echeverria and Kitlas became friends in grade school, and continued to grow up experiencing many life-changing events together, securing a bond that eventually extended to music, and a decision to make it their ultimate ambition. The band signed to Hopeless Records before they even received their high school diplomas.
More than just a sum of its parts, the writing process for Anarbor is a group united, with each member adding input in acoustic jam sessions that allows everyone to collaborate and contribute creatively. It‚Äôs a cohesion that allowed each member‚Äôs personal preferences and talents shine when it came to recording.

Sharing the stage with everyone from Fall Out Boy to the Gin Blossoms, as well as a coveted spot on this year‚Äôs Take Action! Tour, Anarbor is gaining steady recognition as the diverse band to watch among a sea of faux rock ‚Äòn rollers. This motivated and utterly gifted band will resonate with any listener who knows a thing or two about learning who you are and putting your ambitions into motion.
‚ÄúWe want people to walk away feeling comforted and confident in themselves,‚Äù Kitlas said. ‚ÄúMusic is a universal language that everyone can relate to. We talk about our real life stories, feelings and situations. You can expect real music and real lyrics, no filler.‚Äù

More recently, Anarbor independently released their eponymous third studio album entitled, ‚ÄúAnarbor‚Äù in June of 2016. The album was self-funded and produced by long-time collaborator Matt Keller (Lydia, The Maine, The Summer Set, Katastro). Anarbor is comprised of lead vocalist and bassist Slade Echeverria, guitarist Adam Juwig and guitarist Danny Stravers.

                                        Anastacia is an American singer-songwriter born on September 17, 1968. Anastacia has been highly successful in Europe, Asia, South Africa and South America, but has not had as much success in her native United States. Her debut album, ""Not That Kind"", released in 2000, achieved multi-platinum sales in Australia, New Zealand and much of Europe. This resulting in her being critically acclaimed by both Elton John and Michael Jackson.

After having the 4th biggest European single and biggest Australian single of 2000 she was awarded ""Best-selling International Artist"" in 2000. Her next two albums continued her multi-platinum selling success throughout Europe making her one of the fastest and biggest selling artists of the new millennium.

In 2005, she was recognized for worldwide sales of over 20 million albums/records. Anastacia is world-renowned for her powerful soul voice, and her small stature, 5 feet 3 inches or 160 cm, this has led to her being nicknamed ""The Little Lady with The Big Voice"". She is also known for her trademark glasses (often darkly tinted)..

                                        Liverpool's Anathema, started out in the early '90s as strictly a doom metal outfit, with the requisite growled vocals and the trademark muddy sound, but when original singer Darren White left the band in 1995, with guitarist Vincent Cavanagh taking the reins, Anathema started their slow journey into completely uncharted (and unexpected) territory. In fact, Anathema's metamorphosis over the past decade is one of the most remarkable band transformations in recent memory, as album after album has sounded more and more progressive and melodic, in no small part fueled by Cavanagh's superb singing voice. 2001's A Fine Day to Exit, aided by excellent songs like Release and Pressure, was an artistic breakthrough, as the band completely shed themselves of their goth roots, while still putting out powerful, brooding hard rock.

The band recorded one self-titled album in 1989, then went on tour playing what it called ""An Evening of Yes Music Plus"" a name they also used for their subsequent live album, which brought about a lawsuit by the remaining members of Yes. However the bands soon resolved their differences and produced an album entitled ""Union"" (1991) under a reunited Yes (featuring both classic and ""90125"" lineups) which effectively spelled the disolution of Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe as a separate entity.

                                        Angus & Julia Stone are a brother-sister duo from Newport on the Northern Beaches of Sydney, Australia. Angus Stone and Julia Stone began to collaborate on their musical endeavours in early 2006. Prior to that, both had performed as solo artists, principally at open mike nights, but with each using the other as a backing partner.

                                        Born and raised in Sydney, Australia, singer/songwriter Angus Stone first garnered the public's attention as one half of the internationally successful sibling folk duo Angus & Julia Stone. With their distinctive vocal styles, Julia's breathy and ethereal and Angus' smoky and confident, the siblings released their debut album, A Book Like This, to critical acclaim in 2007. After the release of 2010's Down The Way, the pair began working on solo projects, with Julia issuing Memory Machine (2010) and By The Horns (2012), and Angus unveiling the feisty and rollicking Smoking Gun under the pseudonym Lady Of The Sunshine before returning to more traditional country-folk-inflected territory with 2012's Broken Brights, which was released under his birth name. A third Angus & Julia Stone LP, produced by Rick Rubin and titled simply Angus & Julia Stone, arrived in 2014. Angus then retreated to his farm house and put together an album with a more electric, 90's slacker rock sound than on prior projects, born of jamming with friends in his recording studio on the property. Using the pseudonym Dope Lemon, he released Honey Bones in the spring of 2016.

                                        Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) band (1985-1990, 2004-2016) and Alternative Rock (Modern Rock) band (1993-2003) from New York, Pennsylvania (USA).

Anthrax was formed in 1981 by Scott Ian and Danny Lilker.  Initially, both Scott Ian and Danny Lilker played guitar but after several quick line-up changes, Lilker moved to bass.  Members rotated in and out of Anthrax on a frequent basis early on but by 1983, the band coalesced with Ian, Lilker, Neil Turbin (vocals), Dan Spitz (guitar) and Charlie Benante (drums).   This line-up went in the studio with Ross The Boss of Manowar producing to record the tune ""Soldiers Of Metal"" for their first 7"" release (the B-side featured a demo version of the song ""Howling Furies"" with Greg D'Angelo on drums).

In 1984, the band recorded their first LP, ""Fistful Of Metal"".  Shortly afterwards, Lilker was fired, soon followed by Neil Turbin.  Lilker was replaced by Frank Bello.  Turbin was replaced by Matt Fallon but the union was short-lived.  Soon, Joey Belladonna, from upstate NY, was drafted as vocalist.  From 1985 through 1991, this line-up would record 4 LPs and 2 EPs (plus various singles) and find worldwide success as one of the top selling thrash metal bands.  In 1987, Anthrax released the single ""I'm The Man"", a jokey rap tune featuring Ian, Benante, and Bello, all big rap fans, on vocals while Belladonna played the drums.   A more serious rap/metal excursion occurred in 1991 when Anthrax collaborated with Public Enemy on a re-working of PE's 1987 tune ""Bring The Noise"".  The song and resulting Anthrax/Public Enemy tour was a big success.  

In 1992, Anthrax fired Joey Belladonna.  He was replaced by John Bush of Armored Saint.  The new line-up released ""The Sound Of White Noise"".  The record saw Anthrax shedding much of its signature Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) for an Alternative Rock (Modern Rock) sound and was a critical and commercial success. Dan Spitz departed the band after touring for the release.  The rest of the decade would be marked by commercial woes and label problems. For the next few releases, lead guitar was provided by Charlie Benante, guitar tech Paul Crook (who would also be the band's live lead guitarist but would never be made an official member of the band) and Dimebag Darrell of Pantera.  In 1999,  Anthrax released the greatest hits album ""Return Of The Killer A's"" which featured Joey Belladonna return for a duet with John Bush on a cover of the Temptations' song ""Ball Of Confusion"". A planned tour that would feature both Bush and Belladonna was scrapped when the band could not reach a financial agreement with Belladonna.  

In 2001, Rob Caggiano was hired as the band's lead guitarist and in 2003 the new line-up released ""We've Come For You All"".  The album garnered some of Anthrax's best reviews since ""The Sound Of White Noise"". In 2004, Anthrax recorded ""The Greater Of Two Evils"" which featured re-recordings of songs from the Turbin and Belladonna eras.  After the recording, Frank Bello left the group.  Armored Saint bassist Joey Vera joined the band for the supporting tour of ""The Greater Of Two Evils"".

In 2005, the band made the surprise announcement that the line-up of Ian/Benante/Bello/Spitz/Belladonna would be reuniting for live performances, although Ian and Benante stressed that they also planned to continue working with Bush and Caggiano.  This line-up toured together until 2007.  Although there was talk of recording, Ian announced that the band was once-again dropping Belladonna, stating that he was not willing to ""move forward"".  Unfortunately for Anthrax, John Bush was unwilling to return to the group.  In need of a vocalist, the group hired Dan Nelson, a relative unknown.  Rob Caggiano also returned to the band as Spitz went back to his job as a Swiss watchmaker, a trade he'd been involved in since leaving Anthrax.

The group toured with Dan Nelson for 2 years and recorded an album, entitled ""Worship Music"".  However, in the summer of 2009, Nelson was removed from the band.   Anthrax persuaded John Bush to return for some live dates, but the singer declined to rejoin the band full-time.  In 2010, Anthrax announced that Joey Belladonna had returned.   ‚ÄúWorship Music‚Äù, with Belladonna on vocals, was released the following year.

arcturus,"
                                        Arcturus was formed in Norway in 1987 by Sverd (keyboards, guitar) and Hellhammer (drums) of Mayhem. They were later joined by Marius Vold (vocals). They were formed in 1986 originally as a Death Metal band called Mortem and they released ""Slow Death"" as a self-produced demo and as a 7"" EP (on the Putrefaction label) in 1987. In 1990 they changed name to Arcturus and later they also changed style to Black Metal. They also released another 7"" EP, which was their real official debut, named ""My Angel"", and released in 1991. Marius Vold left after the release. 

They later recruited Garm (vocals) of Ulver and Samoth (guitar) of Emperor. Together they recorded the MCD ""Constellation"" on Nocturnal Art Productions, which was released in 1994. After the release Samoth had to leave the band because he got arrested (Church burnings). Two new members were brought into the band, Skoll (bass) of Ved Buens Ende and Carl August Tidemann (guitar) of Tritonus and Winds. In 1995 they recorded their debut album ""Aspera Hiems Symfonia"". 

Carl August Tidemann left the band and was replaced by Knut M. Valle. With a new member they recorded their second full-length, ""La Masquerade Infernale"", and released it in 1997. A compilation cd followed in 1999, ""Disguised Masters"". Skoll left the band and was replaced by Dag F. Gravem. In 2002 they released ""The Sham Mirrors"". The album also featured Ihsahn of Emperor and Mathias Eick as additional musicians. In 2003 Garm left the band to focus on his record label and other projects. He was replaced by √òyvind H√¶geland (Manitou, Lunaris, Spiral Architect). 

In 2005 they released their last studio album ""Sideshow Symphonies"" and in 2006 the live DVD ""Shipwrecked in Oslo"".

On April 16, 2007, it was announced that the band would be breaking up, and more details were revealed in an official statement released on the band's website on April 17th, where the band confirmed the split.

In September of 2011, Artisan (a blog and project run by Jens F. Ryland and Asgeir Mickelson) announced the official return of the band.

                                        Formed in the North Carolina coastline community of Wrightsville Beach in 2001, the riff-fueled, distortion-driven rock of ASG that can be found on their latest effort has actually been at the band's core since its inception.

Initially forming as a three-piece instrumental project, due to the lack of a dedicated vocalist, ASG were intensely focusing on devising tight, driving guitar riffs, locking guitarist Jason Shi in with the rhythm section of bassist Andy Ellis and drummer Scott Key.
But as time passed and no vocalist was found, Shi was eventually forced to step up to the mic.
With Shi becoming more comfortable as a frontman, the group found themselves connecting with Volcom Entertainment, who signed the band and put them in the studio in 2003, to record their debut album, ...The Amplification of Self Gratification.

In 2005 ASG found themselves in a proper studio with proper producers, Matt Hyde and Phil Caivano, recording their sophomore album, Feeling Good Is Good Enough, an album that summoned all the band's potential and spawned a thunderous hard rock creation that equaled what the band had been working towards for the past 3 years.
Shortly after completing Feeling Good Is Good Enough, second guitarist, Jonah Citty, was added to help recreate the album's sounds live, which was none too soon as the band quickly found themselves on the road with the likes of 
The Sword, Torche, Dwarves, and CKY.

In June 2007 ASG returned to Los Angeles to record their fourth album, entitled Win Us Over, with Matt Hyde again.
Win Us Over, is a vivid, psychedelic, and panoramic thrust that is just as much for the ears as it is for the aura; an experience

                                        Hailed as a new Loretta Lynn by The Wall Street Journal, and compared to Taylor Swift by Entertainment Weekly, Ashton Shepherd stormed the country music world with her sass and southern charm in her Billboard Top 25 hits ""Takin' Off This Pain"", ""Look It Up"", and ""Sounds So Good"". In similar style to Miranda Lambert, the former MCA recording artist lets her genuine Alabama twang and no-nonsense attitude take it's course in her clever lyricism. The chart-topping artist secured a nomination for Top New Female Vocalist in the 2009 Academy of Country Music Awards, as well as a Female Music Video nomination in the 2011 American Country Awards. Ashton is also featured on Luke Bryan's ""Tailgate Blues"" on his Tailgates & Tanlines album.

                                        At the Gates was formed in 1990 in Gothenburg, Sweden on the ashes of split-up death/black metal band Grotesque. Founding members were Tomas Lindberg (vocals), Anders Bj√∂rler (guitars), Adrian Erlandsson (drums), Jonas Bj√∂rler (bass) and Alf Svensson (guitars). Their debut EP, ""Gardens of Grief"", was released in 1991 by their local label, Dolores. Following this they went on a Swedish tour with bands such as Dismember, Bolt Thrower, Massacre and Immolation. After the tour they were signed to Peaceville Records who released their debut album ""The Red in the Sky Is Ours"" in 1992. It was a success in the Death Metal underground.

After touring with My Dying Bride in 1992 they recorded the second album ""With Fear I Kiss the Burning Darkness"", which was released in 1993. At this point Alf Svensson decided to leave the band to concentrate on his other careers as tattoo artist and comic illustrator. He was replaced by former House Of Usher guitarist Martin Larsson. To support the album the band went on another tour, this time with Cradle of Fear and Anathema.

In 1994 they released ""Terminal Spirit Disease"" which was another success. A lot of tours followed. 

The band was eventually signed to Earache Records and entered the studio one last time to record ""Slaughter of the Soul"", which was released in 1995. They won various awards and the band also joined major tours in the US with Morbid Angel, Napalm Death etc. Shortly after the tours were over, Anders however decided to quit the band and as a result the whole band split apart at the height of their career.

After the split up Adrian and Jonas joined Patrik Jensen to form The Haunted and not too long after Anders also joined the band.
Tomas Lindberg went on to make music with bands such as Skitsystem, Disfear, Lock Up, The Great Deveicer, The Crown.

In 2001, a compilation by the name ""Suicidal Final Art"" was released.

In 2008 At The Gates announced their reunion tour.

In 2014 the band announced that a new studio album was in the making. Their fifth full length ""At War With Reality"" was released in October 2014.

atheist,"
                                        Atheist are a technical death metal band from Florida, USA.  The band is known for its highly complex playing and for incorporating jazz and latin elements into their sound.  They were intially founded in 1984 under then name Oblivion, which was soon changed to R.A.V.A.G.E. (Raging Atheist Vowing A Gory End).  The band issued several demos under this name before shortening their moniker to just Atheist.  The band released their first album, ""Piece Of Time"" in 1989.  The line-up was Kelly Shaefer (vocals, guitar), Rand Burkey (guitar), Roger Patterson (bass), and Steve Flynn (drums).  In 1991, as the band was preparing their follow up, Patterson was killed in a car accident.  He was replaced by Tony Choy (Pestilence).  Atheist broke up the following year but in 1993, Kelly Shaefer put together a new line-up featuring Choy, Jason Greenbaum (drums), and Frank Emmi (guitar).  Growing problems with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome forced Shaefer to limit his guitar playing to just rhythm guitar.  Just prior to recording their new album, Rand Burkey rejoined the group.  The album, ""Elements"" toned down the metal influences and increased the jazz and latin elements.  Atheist split again after its release.

In 2005, Relapse Records reissued Atheist's 3 albums with bonus tracks that included demos and live tracks.  In 2006, it was announced the Atheist was reuniting with Shaefer, Flynn, Choy, and Burkey along with guitarist Sonny Carson, as tendonitis and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome prevented Shaefer from playing guitar.  However, personal legal problems forced Burkey to exit and he was replaced by Chris Baker.  In 2010, it was announced the Choy had left the band for other projects.  Later that year, Shaefer, Flynn, Baker and guitarist Jonathan Thompson recorded the album ""Jupiter"", with Thompson recording all the bass parts.

History:
This unique act, an R'n'B/ soul group from Scotland with only two black musicians became one of the best selling and sounding funk bands in the world. The horn section started out as ""The Dundee Horns"". They can be heard on Johnny Nash's reggae hit ""I Can See Clearly Now"".
Eric Clapton and Bonnie Bramlett (of Delaney & Bonnie) helped them on their way to becoming a household name. But it wasn't until they reached the US and were signed to Atlantic Records  that the Average White Band really took off (Jerry Wexler signed them on the spot, after they hit him at home on one of his parties, where they played him the basic tracks for what would become the White Album: ""AWB"").
Arif Mardin became their producer and together they couldn't do wrong. All of their seventies albums reached gold or even platinum status and hits such as the timeless ""Pick Up The Pieces"" and ""Cut The Cake"" were number 1 hits on the U.S. Billboard Charts. 
Tragedy hit the young group in 1974 when their drummer, Robbie McIntosh died at a Hollywood party in a drug-related incident, but their act only became stronger.
The Double album ""Person To Person"", recorded during their American 1975 Tour, is among the best selling live funk albums ever.
They reached the white market with their unique sound without losing respect from the core Soul/ R'n'B lover in the black communities.

At the age of 16, Bergling began posting his remixes on electronic music forums, which led to his first record deal. He rose to prominence in 2011 with his single ""Levels"". His debut studio album, True (2013), blended electronic music with elements of multiple genres and received generally positive reviews. It peaked in the top ten in more than fifteen countries and topped international dance charts; the lead single, ""Wake Me Up"", topped most music markets in Europe and reached number four in the United States. In 2015, Bergling released his second studio album, Stories, and in 2017 he released an EP, Avƒ´ci (01). His catalogue also included the singles ""I Could Be the One"" with Nicky Romero, ""You Make Me"", ""X You"", ""Hey Brother"", ""Addicted to You"", ""The Days"", ""The Nights"", ""Waiting for Love"", ""Without You"" and ""Lonely Together"". Bergling was nominated for a Grammy Award for his work on ""Sunshine"" with David Guetta in 2012 and ""Levels"" in 2013. Several music publications credit Bergling as among the DJs who ushered electronic music into Top 40 radio in the early 2010s. Bergling retired from touring in 2016 due to health problems, having suffered stress and poor mental health for several years. On 20 April 2018, Bergling committed suicide in Muscat, Oman.

                                        Awie started his music career in Kuala Lumpur in 1986, fronting the Malaysian rock band ""Wings"",[2] which had an original line-up of Black (drums), Syam (guitars), Eddie (bass) and Awie (lead vocals). The debuted with the album ""Belenggu Irama"". Their subsequent album ""Hukum Karma"" features successful singles 'Misteri Mimpi Syakilla' (composed by J.S. Kevin) and 'Taman Rashidah Utama' (written by a producer Bob Lokman). Various albums followed, including 'Teori Domino', 'Jerangkung Dalam Almari' and 'Bazooka Penaka'. A number of Wings's hits are composed by singer-songwriter M. Nasir.

Awie left the band (1994) after reported disagreements with the then-drummer Black, and pursued a career as a solo artist and actor. He re-joined Wings in 2002 after lukewarm fan response to his replacements Mus (formerly from May) and Mel (a club singer). The band is still active. Their recent concert appearances and recordings include 'Wings Alive 2006' and 'Wings Live In KL 1991'. On top of that, Awie had joined the best band in Indonesian called Samudera Astana.

Bruno, who had been a member of Home Town Hero and Under the Influence of Giants, needed a break from the collaborative process and hoped to find a place for some of his songs that didn‚Äôt fit with his other bands. With AWOLNATION, Bruno built a kind of creative free-for-all for himself, allowing him to blend genres as he wanted in a style reminiscent of Beck, blending live instrumentation, electronic elements, and slick production into an electro-pop hybrid that draws from the whole of pop music. In 2011, AWOLNATION made its full-length debut, releasing Megalithic Symphony on Red Bull Records. ~ Gregory Heaney

                                        Formed in 2012 by Bullet For My Valentine's Matt Tuck and Pitchshifter's Jason Bowld, AxeWound came together after the pair bonded over their shared love of metal. Deciding they wanted to make an album, AxeWound rose to supergroup status after the pair recruited Cancer Bats' Liam Cormier, Glamour Of The Kill's Mike Kingswood, and Rise To Remain's Joe Copcutt, creating a lineup of modern metalcore heavy-hitters to bring the project screaming into the world. Wanting to get away from the pressures and expectations of their other bands, the members of AxeWound explore a wide variety of sounds, with the band dabbling in thrash, groove metal, and metalcore, acting as a remedy to the homogeneity that can build up in the metal scene. With an easy songwriting chemistry, AxeWound worked quickly, writing an album's worth of material in under a month and making their full-length debut in 2012 with ""Vultures"".

                                        Baby Bash or Baby Beesh (real name: Ronnie Ray Bryant) (born on October 18, 1975 in Vallejo, California, USA) is a Mexican-American rapper.

Baby Bash grew up with his Latin side of the family. His Mexican mother and Anglo-American father both went to prison when Bash was young, resulting in little contact with them. Growing up, his uncles and grandmother exposed him to many different types of musical genres. He also worked with the late Mac Dre.

Baby Bash's career began to rise when he went to Houston, Texas, where he met fellow rapper South Park Mexican. Thus, he decided to re-locate there. Prior to his success as a solo artist he was part of rap groups Potna Deuce, Latino Velvet and N2Deep. Bash's debut album entitled Savage Dreams was released on the independent label Dope House Records in 2001. The acclaim he received soon caught the attention of Universal Records, who signed him later that year. In 2003, Baby Bash released his first album on a major label, Tha Smokin' Nephew, and Super Saucy in 2005. He recently was featured in Paula DeAnda's first single ""Doin' Too Much"" from her debut album Paula DeAnda.

On June 26th, 2007, actor Shia LaBeouf started a beef with Baby Bash on San Diego radio station KHTS-FM Channel 933.

The band later added guitarist Joakim ""Jolly"" Karlsson and drummer Nick Folio, releasing its critically acclaimed debut self-titled album in 2016 off Sumerian Records.

Sebastian went on to say that his influences include nu-metal pioneer bands such as Linkin Park, Deftones, Slipknot, Disturbed and 30 Seconds To Mars. He also stated that he has been influenced by indie-based act such as Depeche Mode, The Weeknd and The Neighbourhood.

bad-religion,"
                                        Punk/Rock band formed in 1980 in San Fernando Valley/Los Angeles, CA, US by Greg Graffin (vocals), Brett Gurewitz (guitar), Jay Ziskrout (drums), and Jay Bentley (bass). All the members were teenagers when the band started. Only Graffin has remained with the band through every phase of its career, although Bentley and Gurewitz have participated for substantial chunks of time. Graffin and Gurewitz are the band's primary songwriters, with other members contributing occasionally. The band is known for their rapid-fire songs with a melodic edge and strong backing harmonies.

Bad Religion released their first record, a self-titled EP, in 1981 on Epitaph Records, a label Gurewitz started after borrowing money from his father.  The band released their first full length, ""How Could Hell Be Any Worse?"", in 1982. Midway through the recording for the album, Ziskrout quit the band and the record was finished with drummer Pete Finestone. In 1983, the band abruptly shifted gears, issuing the keyboard-heavy, prog rock influenced ""Into The Unknown"", on which neither Bentley (who quit during the recording of the first track) nor Finestone appeared. The results were disastrous, with the band facing considerable backlash from fans and Epitaph immediately pulling the album off record store shelves. For his part, Gurewitz blamed his participation on his increasing drug habit, although he was quick to point out that the sober Graffin had no such excuse to fall back on, and has disowned the album. With Epitaph out of money and the band's reputation in tatters, Gurewitz quit and the band split. Graffin soon moved out of state for college, but returned to California in 1984 and was convinced by Circle Jerks guitarist Greg Hetson to reform Bad Religion with him on guitar. Recruiting Pete Finestone and bassist Tim Gallegos, the band issued a 12"" EP, called ""Back To The Known"", with Gurewitz producing but not playing on the record.

Graffin and Hetson spent the next few years playing sporadically with various line-ups. Eventually, Finestone and Bentley returned on a full-time basis. In 1987, a newly sober Brett Gurewitz returned to the fold and the band continued as a five-piece. In 1988, Bad Religion issued a new LP, ""Suffer"", to enthusiastic fans and critics. This lineup released 2 more albums before Finestone departed in 1991. He was replaced by Bobby Schayer. In 1993, immediately following the release of their 7th LP, ""Recipe For Hate"", the band jumped from Epitaph to Atlantic Records. Following the release of 1994's ""Stranger Than Fiction"", Brett Gurewitz left the group. Officially, it was said that his reason for leaving was to concentrate on Epitaph following the huge commercial success of the album ""Smash"" by The Offspring, and he also expressed displeasure with the band's deal with Atlantic. However, it was later revealed the Gurewitz's primary reason for leaving was due to tension with Bentley (in 1996, Gurewitz released a single with his new band, Daredevils, whose A-side, ""Hate You"" was written about Bentley). Graffin and Gurewitz also publicly feuded for a short time after the departure. Gurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker (ex-Minor Threat and Dag Nasty). The band would record 3 more albums for Atlantic with Graffin as the primary songwriter, although 1998's ""No Substance"" featured significant contributions from the other members of Bad Religion. However, the albums were met with largely mixed critical and commercial responses. Meanwhile, Gurewitz had relapsed into drug abuse and faced a number of personal and legal problems. In 2000, a cleaned-up and sober Gurewitz made a guest appearance on the band's LP, ""The New America"", prompting rumors of a reunion. The album was the group's last for Atlantic.

Following the release of ""The New America"", Bobby Schayer exited the group, as a shoulder injury barred him from playing drums. His replacement was Brooks Wackerman (ex-Suicidal Tendencies). In 2001, it was announced that not only had Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band, but that they would also be returning to Epitaph Records. It turned out the Brett's role would be mostly limited to songwriting and production, as his work with Epitaph makes extended touring impractical, although he would make appearances with the band when they performed in Los Angeles. It was also revealed that since the reunion, Gurewitz rarely actually plays guitar on the albums. Most of the guitar parts are recorded by Brian Baker as he is the most proficient guitarist, although Gurewitz does record parts if he wants to. The band has continued to record and tour steadily since returning to Epitaph.

                                        Hair / Glam Metal (Heavy Metal) band from Los Angeles, California (USA).

Badlands was formed in 1988 by former Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Jake E. Lee and one-time Black Sabbath singer Ray Gillen.  According to the book ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"" by Gary Sharpe-Young, former Black Sabbath bassist Dave ""The Beast"" Spitz claimed to be instrumental in pulling together Lee, Gillen, and drummer Eric Singer (another Black Sabbath alum) only to find his own entry into the band vetoed by Lee in favor of Lee's friend Greg Chaisson.  The band released their debut LP in 1989.  Singer left the group afterwords and was replaced by Jeff Martin (formerly known as the vocalist of Racer X).  During work for their follow up, Lee and Gillen found themselves at odds over the direction of the band (Gillen allegedly favored a more commercial direction, Lee preferred the bluesy hard rock of their debut).  By the time of the release of their 2nd album, 1991's ""Voodoo Highway"", Gillen was out of the band.  The band toured with singer Debby Holiday and later worked with vocalist John West but they were dropped by their label and ultimately called it quits in 1993.  Ray Gillen passed away from AIDS-related complications in December of 1993.  A collection of demos, titled ""Dusk"" was released posthumously in 1999.

behemoth,"
                                        Began as a Black Metal band and transitioned into a Death Metal band.

It was in 1991 that Behemoth was formed (initially as Baphometh) by frontman Nergal (Holocausto at that time). They released a few demos, ""Endless Damnation"" (1992), ""The Return Of The Northern Moon"" (1993) and ""From The Pagan Vastlands"" (1993). ""From The Pagan Vastlands"" being the demo that really showed what they wanted. They signed with an Italian company called Entropy Rec., and released their debut mini-album entitled ""And the forests dream eternally"" in 1994. A year later they recorded their first full-length ""Sventevith (storming near the Baltic)"". The album gave them the attention they wanted and they got a deal with the German Solistitium Rec., where they also recorded and released their second album ""Grom,"" a very experimental album, which included female vocals, synths and acoustic guitar. They also finally did a European tour where they gained stage experience and a good reputation. 

In 1997 they did a split with Damnation, re-released ""The Return Of The Northern Moon"" and recorded their third album ""Pandemonic Incantations,"" which featured a new drummer, Inferno. 

In 1998 they got a two album record deal with Italian Avantgarde Music. They released ""Satanica"" 1999 and it was a huge success and secured the band tour support to Deicide and Satyricon.

In 2001 they released ""Thelema.6"" which gained them even more fame and led them to the European tour X-Mass Festivals, Wacken Open Air, With Full Force, Inferno Festival, Mystic Festival, Mind Over Matter etc....

In 2002 they started work on their 6th album. They gave it the title ""Zos Kia Cultus (Here and Beyond)"". One of their most impressive albums to date (the band had spent almost 700 hours making it). And again, a lot of tours followed. In 2003 they released the EP ""Conjuration"".
The music style on Thelema.6 and Zos Kia Cultus can be characterized as death metal with industrial unfluences.

In 2007 band released ""The Apostasy,"" which showed the further evolution of Behemoth's music style, and established the band's ""visit card"" - famous ""blackened death metal"" style.

In 2009 band released ""Evangelion,"" which was heavily supported with massive worldwide touring.

In 2014 Behemoth released their 10th full-length album ""The Satanist,"" which is also supported with worldwide touring, including the scandal-famous Russian Satanist tour.

                                        Third wave ska band formed in October 1995 in Allston, Massachusetts, USA.

Their first release was on their own Fork in Hand Records label, but have since teamed with Springman Records and SideOneDummy. The band has been noted for its strict DIY work ethic, such as engineering, producing, and releasing their own albums and videos and self-promotion of their own shows.

In 2000 the band recorded a gangsta rap album, Porch Life, and distributed it unofficially via cassette tape. In 2003 the album was officially released on CD through Fork in Hand.  They have also recorded splits with Melt-Banana, Brain Failure, and Drexel.

Big D and the Kids Table have played 200 shows a year, on average,[in support of bands including The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Dropkick Murphys, Rancid, and Alexisonfire, and have become regular performers on the Warped Tour. The band has also performed in the Summer of Ska Tour 2006 and the Ska Is Dead tour.

In the fall and winter of 2007 the band embarked on their first-ever large scale headlining tour, The Steady Riot Tour, named after the 2007 release.

Different stories exist about the band name's origin, especially about running over pets named Big D. However, lead singer Dave McWane has said that the band actually got their name when a friend, Conor Donnelly, told him that if he ever started a band he should call it Big D and the Kids Table, so he did.

Following high school, he made a couple attempts at relocating to Nashville in the hopes of getting a career in music off the ground, finally landing a job there at a concrete company, while still finding time to play at clubs on the side and work on song demos. When singer Mark Wills put a hold on one of his songs, Currington met and began writing with Wills' producer, Carson Chamberlain, which eventually led to a recording contract with Mercury Records. His first single, ""Walk a Little Straighter,"" was released in 2003, and drew heavily on Currington's experiences with an alcoholic father (the chorus for the song was actually written when Currington was only 12 years old). A debut album, Billy Currington, was released on Mercury Records in 2003. A second album, Doin' Somethin' Right, followed in 2005 on Mercury Nashville. Three years later, Currington delivered the eclectic, R&B-inflected Little Bit of Everything, also on Mercury Nashville. In 2010 Currington returned with his tenth studio effort, Enjoy Yourself, featuring the Troy Jones co-written single ""Pretty Good at Drinkin' Beer.""

birds-of-tokyo,"
                                        Birds of Tokyo is a four-piece alternative rock band from Perth, Western Australia. Their debut album Day One, gained them domestic success with it reaching No. 3 on the AIR Independent Album charts, spending a total of 36 consecutive weeks in the top 10. In 2008, the band released Universes, which made it to No. 3 on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart. In 2010 the band released its highest charting album to date, Birds of Tokyo, which reached No. 2 on the ARIA Albums Chart.

Somehow Birds Of Tokyo snuck up on us. In the dozen years since forming in Perth these five unassuming guys have gradually grown - song by song, gig by gig - into Australia's biggest contemporary rock band. They may not yet be household names but their songs have been heard in everyone's home. 

The group has won multiple ARIA and APRA awards. They've co-headlined virtually every important music festival in this country. They've had tracks in major TV and film campaigns and even played the AFL Grand Final. All of this was driven by a string of emotive anthems that have dominated radio, from Triple J's ""Hottest 100"" to the commercial FM charts. Big songs like ""Plans,"" ""Broken Bones,"" ""Wild At Heart,"" ""This Fire,"" ""Lanterns,"" ""Anchor,"" and their latest hit single ""I'd Go With You Anywhere."" It's an airplay streak unmatched by any Australian artist since Powderfinger.

Even so, for most people Birds Of Tokyo have still somehow 'flown under the radar.' Until now.

Their new compilation album - 'Playlist' - gathers all these songs and more into one undeniable 18 track album. For all but their most hardcore fans the collection is a revelation. Casual listeners will be surprised to realize that they actually already know the words and melodies for most of these tunes.

                                        Biz Markie (born Marcel Hall April 8, 1964 in Brooklyn, New York) is an African American East Coast hip hop artist best known for humorous singles like ""Just a Friend"".

Markie's career began in the early 1980s as a performer, then a human beatbox for MC Shan and Roxanne Shante, among others. He signed to the Cold Chillin' record label in 1988  and released Goin' Off, an underground hit. ""Just a Friend"" (from The Biz Never Sleeps) was released the following year, and it became a mainstream hit in the United States.

As one of hip hop's biggest stars of the time, Biz had a lot of pressure for his third album, I Need a Haircut. The album was a commercial disaster, exacerbated by a lawsuit from Gilbert O'Sullivan for sampling ""Alone Again (Naturally)"" in the song ""Alone Again"". The lawsuit, Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Brothers Records, Inc., changed hip hop forever, as afterwards, all samples were cleared with the original artist before they could be used.

Biz continued his career in 1993, releasing All Samples Cleared!, but the record was another commercial disappointment. For the next few years, Biz worked with the Beastie Boys occasionally, began DJing and kept a low profile.

Within the last few years, Biz appeared in Men in Black II with Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones.

In 2005, Biz was featured on the VH1 television reality show, ""Celebrity Fit Club"", where overweight celebrities are shown attempting to lose weight.

He has also made a career as a DJ, giving performances where he uses his somewhat voluminous gut to move a record on a turntable and thus scratch.

It mainly composed of rappers will.i.am, apl.de.ap, and Taboo, and singer Fergie. Originally an alternative hip hop group, they have since added R&B, soul, funk, dance, electro and techno influences. Though founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1995, it was not until the release of their third album Elephunk in 2003 that they found widespread acclaim and achieved high record sales.

black-flag,"
                                        Black Flag was one of America's first hardcore bands. They emerged from Southern California to gain international prominence, touring enough to become a major attraction in virtually every city where a scene existed and undoubtedly inspiring others to get in the game. Via the band's SST label, Black Flag played an essential role in the development and popularization of American punk. Through countless revolving-door personnel changes ‚Äî which spawned numerous spin-off bands along the way ‚Äî Black Flag persevered until 1986, finally dissolving after locating and exploring the zone where punk and heavy metal intersect and overlap.

Guitarist and songwriter Greg Ginn founded Black Flag in 1976 along with vocalist Keith Morris. They were intially called Panic, adopting the Black Flag moniker a few years later. Ginn remained the only constant member in the band until their split in the summer of 1986. In 2003, Ginn resurrected the Black Flag for a couple shows to benefit cat rescue organizations. These shows featured contributions from some old members as well as new players and reactions were mixed. In January 2013, Ginn announced that he was relaunching the band with vocalist Ron Reyes (the second of 4 vocalists to pass through the group in its initial run) with the intention of extensive touring and recording new material. At the same time, Keith Morris and one-time bassist and SST Records co-founder Chuck Dukowski launched Flag, which also featured former members Bill Stevenson and Dez Cadena as well as Descendents/ALL guitarist Stephen Egerton, to perform the music of Black Flag.

                                        Drawing on blues, psychedelia, acid rock, Led Zeppelin and The Velvet Underground, Black Mountain's sound is a cross between the darkness and grit of [The Warlocks and The Brian Jonestown Massacre's trippiness, with a folky undertow weaving through it all. Black Mountain leader Stephen McBean previously fronted the semi-acoustic cowpunk band Jerk With A Bomb, but after releasing two albums, he reshaped the Vancouver-area band into a group called Black Mountain. After debuting in October 2004 on Jagjaguwar with the 12"" Druganaut, Black Mountain stayed with the label for an eponymous full-length, issued the following January. Joining McBean for the album were local players Matthew Camirand, Jeremy Schmidt, Joshua Wells, and Amber Webber, listed collectively to preserve the band's communal ethic. (Black Mountain ran concurrent to and intermingled with McBean's other band, lo-fi classic rockers Pink Mountaintops). The debut album earned enthusiastic reviews in the music press, and Coldplay tapped Black Mountain to open for them on an arena tour.

black-sabbath,"
                                        Considered by many to be the first heavy metal band, Black Sabbath was formed in 1968 by Tony Iommi, Ozzy Osbourne, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward.  The band's original name was the Polka Tulk Blues Band (later shortened to Polka Tulk) and later Earth before becoming Black Sabbath.  The original line-up lasted until 1979, after which Osbourne was fired and replaced by Ronnie James Dio. The line-up changes would continue, with no line-up remaining intact for consecutive studio releases. Throughout the changes, only Tony Iommi and keyboardist Geoff Nicholls, who also joined the band in 1979, would remain with Black Sabbath, although Nicholls would not always be credited as a full member. In 1997, Iommi, Butler, Ward, and Osbourne reunited, touring and releasing a live album in 1998, although a long-rumored studio release did not appear (the group attempted to record a new album in 2001 with producer Rick Rubin but the sessions were scrapped). After that, the group periodically reunited to tour with Ozzy's ""Ozzfest"" tour. In 2004, longtime keyboardist Geoff Nicholls was replaced by Adam Wakeman for an Ozzfest tour. No reason was given for the replacement. In 2006, the original line-up was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame. 

In 2007, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ronnie James Dio, and drummer Vinny Appice (who were featured on 1981's ""Mob Rules"" and 1992's ""Dehumanizer"") announced that they would tour together as Heaven & Hell (with Iommi, who owns the Black Sabbath name, deciding to keep the Black Sabbath name solely for the original line-up in light of their Rock 'n' Roll HOF induction) to support a Dio-era greatest hits release, which also featured 3 new Dio/Iommi compositions. A brand new live album was released under the Heaven & Hell name that same year, followed by a studio album in 2009. 

In 2009, Osbourne sued Iommi over control of the Black Sabbath name.  The lawsuit was settled the following year.  In late 2011, it was announced that the original line-up would be recording and touring.  Shortly, afterward, Bill Ward dropped out, stating he had been given a contract that was ""unsignable"".  The three remaining members opted to continue without him.  In 2013, the band released ""13"", their first studio album with Osbourne in 34 years.  The band played their final live show in Birmingham, UK, on February 4, 2017.  Although the band has announced that full-scale touring is done, Tony Iommi has stated that the door is still open for future music and possible live appearances.

blue-oyster-cult,"
                                        Blue √ñyster Cult is a hard rock band from New York, USA. The name Blue √ñyster Cult first came into use in 1971, but the roots of the group date back to 1967 to a psychedelic group called Soft White Underbelly, which featured  Albert Bouchard (drums), Allen Lanier (keyboards, guitar), Donald ""Buck Dharma"" Roeser (guitar), Andy Winters (bass), and Les Braunstein (vocals, AKA Les Vegas) and operated under the guidance of manager/producer Sandy Pearlman.  Braunstein departed in 1969 and was replaced by Eric Bloom.  The band changed their name to The Stalk-Forrest group shortly after.  Later, Winters was fired and replaced by Albert's younger brother, Joe.  The band released their debut album in 1972.  

All the members contributed to the songwriting but lyrics were often provided by people outside of the group, including Sandy Pearlman, rock scribe [A=Richard Meltzer], poets Patti Smith (Lanier's longtime companion) and Jim Carroll, and science fiction author Michael Moorcock, amongst others.  Eric Bloom served as the band's primary lead vocalist, but Donald Roeser sang what are arguably the band's most famous songs, including ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"", ""Godzilla"", and ""Burnin' For You"". The Bouchard brothers also contributed lead vocals.  

1976's ""Agents Of Fortune"", featuring the aforementioned ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"", was the group's most successful studio album.  After a commercial decline in the latter half of the 1970's, the group found renewed success with 1981's ""Fire Of Unknown Origin"".  However, Albert Bouchard was fired after its release (he returned temporarily in 1985).  The band continued but was unable to recapture their commercial fortunes.  Lanier departed in 1985 and Joe Bouchard left in 1986.  Lanier returned in 1987 and the band continued to tour, although they recorded very little.  2001's ""Curse Of The Hidden Mirror"" is the band's last studio recording to date.  Roeser and Bloom continue to tour with new members (Lanier retired from the band in 2006 and passed away in 2013) .

                                        Born: 10 May 1969 in Douarnenez, Brittany, France. 

Grammy Award-nominated French record producer, house music DJ & remixer, and owner of the label Yellow Productions. 
The second name of this stage name, is pronounced ""Sinclair"" (like British computer/engineering brand named after Sir Clive Sinclair), and is often misspelt like this on releases and in publications. 

Noted French house svengali, head honcho of ultra-hip independent label Yellow Productions, and responsible of The Mighty Bop project. Chris lives in Le Marais, the gay quarter of Paris, the city in which he learnt to play his trade as a funk, rap and French hip-hop DJ in 1986, when he was 18. 

Chris 'Le French Kiss' got the name Bob Sinclar from a French spy movie (""Le Magnifique"" directed by Philippe de Broca) and first adopted, to a certain extent, the attitude portrayed by the character in the film. 

In 1998, the release of Sinclar's first album ""Paradise"" sparked a storm of controversy. Thomas Bangalter's song ""Gym Tonic"", which was included on the album without Bangalter's consent, caused legal issues when it used an illegal sample of Jane Fonda. 

However, in 2000, Sinclar's second opus ""Champs √âlys√©es"" confirmed his success with hits such as ""I Feel For You"" and ""Darlin' "". 
Other releases from that period includes his collaboration with Disco artist Cerrone for a compilation of remixes, and the popular Africanism series, which was more deep house oriented. 

Dropping the original concept of ""Bob Sinclar"" after that, the release of ""III"" (2003) and of ""Western Dream"" (2006) established him as a popular/commercial DJ. 

His remixing skills are notable, as he worked for artists such as Ian Pooley, Jamiroquai, Dimitri From Paris, Moby, Fused, and Madonna.

As a highly intelligent student, Bobby Darin dropped out of college and changed his name to 'Bobby Darin' to set out in pursuit of his musical ambitions. During the late 1950s, his first well-known hit ""Splish Splash"" was released, quickly followed by ""Dream Lover"" and the unforgettable ""Mack The Knife"". In 1960 he also began acting in movies and by the early 1970's he had his own television show. Sadly, as a result of multiple bouts with rheumatic fever during his childhood he was left with a damaged heart. This ultimately caught up with him, causing Darin to pass away at the age of 37 on December 20, 1973. He was revered by Dick Clark as one of the greatest entertainers to have lived, and has a discography to prove it.

boehse-onkelz,"
                                        Often controversial German Punk/Hard Rock band from Frankfurt/Germany, formed in 1980, who despite considerable efforts later in their career never quite managed to shake off accusations of hard-right leanings, both in their work and with regards to their core audience. Early work on the latterly radical-right-wing label ""Rock-o-Rama Records"" and the ""indexing"" (banned for open sale to the under18s) of early work did not help. Despite (or possibly because of) this they achieved considerable popular success with almost no media reporting or support: Kevin Russell (vocals), Stephan Weidner (bass guitar), Matthias ""Gonzo"" R√∂hr (lead guitar), Peter ""Pe"" Schorowsky (drums).

The ""Onkelz"" (as they were popularly known) split in 2005 after 25 years together as a band. They celebrated their departure with a huge festival for more than 100.000 people at the Euro Speedway (Lausitzring) in Germany and played two last gigs on June 17th and 18th, 2005.

In January 2014 the band announced their reunion for two shows in June 2014 at the German Hockenheimring. Both shows sold out within minutes.

Soon, however, TV stations started to demand 'Boney M.' to perform the track on TV shows, which made Farian form an actual group. After some initial changes, Frank Farian arrived at the lineup with which the group had their biggest successes: Maizie Williams, Marcia Barrett, Bobby Farrell and Liz Mitchell. The group's major break came in 1978 with ""Rivers Of Babylon"", the second highest selling single of all time in the UK. Boney M. enjoyed over a dozen hit singles throughout Europe between 1976 and 1981. After Farrell was replaced by Reggie Tsiboe, Boney M. had two more hits in 1984.

Frank Farian announced the end of Boney M. in 1986, but the group has continued in some form or other ever since. No new material has been released, except for a couple of singles and the odd new track on compilations. Numerous ""best of"" compilations and remix albums have been released.

Eno collaborated with David Bowie as a writer and musician on Bowie's influential ""Berlin Trilogy"" of albums, ""I'm Afraid Of Americans"" (1997). 
He  has also collaborated with Robert Fripp of King Crimson, Robert Wyatt on his ""Shleep"" (1997) album, with Jon Hassell and with the German duo Cluster.

Initially named British Air Powers, they recorded a 4-track demo before moving to Brighton. Here they renamed themselves British Sea Power after one of their demo tracks. This track was reworked and renamed 'Carrion' which became their first UK Top 40 single in 2003. That year saw the release of their debut album 'The Decline of British Sea Power' on the Rough Trade label. Their sophomore effort 'Open Season' was released in 2005 and spawned their first UK Top 20 single 'It Ended on an Oily Stage'. Three years later, in 2008, their third effort 'Do You Like Rock Music?' earned the band a coveted Mercury Music Prize nomination. The band, now a six-piece, released fourth album 'Valhall Dancehall' in early 2011.

                                        While his tenure as the frontman for the legendary Roxy Music remained his towering achievement, singer Bryan Ferry also carved out a successful solo career which continued in the lush, sophisticated manner perfected on the group's final records. Born September 26, 1945 in Washington, England, Ferry, the son of a coal miner, began his musical career as a singer with the rock outfit the Banshees while studying art at the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne under pop-conceptualist Richard Hamilton. He later joined the Gas Board, a soul group featuring bassist Graham Simpson; in 1970, Ferry and Simpson formed Roxy Music.

Within a few years, Roxy Music had become phenomenally successful, affording Ferry the opportunity to cut his first solo LP in 1973. Far removed from the group's arty glam-rock, These Foolish Things established the path which all of Ferry's solo work -- as well as the final Roxy Music records -- would take, focusing on elegant synth-pop interpretations of '60s hits like Bob Dylan's ""A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall,"" the Rolling Stones' ""Sympathy for the Devil"" and the Beatles' ""You Won't See Me,"" all rendered in the singer's distinct, coolly dramatic manner.

Roxy Music remained Ferry's primary focus, but in 1974 he returned with a second solo effort, Another Time, Another Place, another collection of covers ranging from ""You Are My Sunshine"" to ""It Ain't Me, Babe"" to ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes."" His third venture, 1976's Let's Stick Together, featured remixed, remade, and remodeled versions of Roxy Music hits as well as the usual assortment of covers. 1977's In Your Mind was Ferry's first solo collection of completely original material; the following year's The Bride Stripped Bare, a work rumoured to be inspired by his broken romance with model Jerry Hall, split evenly between new songs and covers.

Ferry did not release another solo album until 1985's Boys and Girls, a sleek, seamless effort that was his first ""official"" solo release following the Roxy breakup in 1983. Boys & Girls contained one of Ferry's best-known solo compositions, ""Slave To Love"".

1987's B√™te Noire displayed a similarly hazy, detailed yet rhythmic soundstage. A long world tour in 1988 and 1989 followed, after which he started recording another album of original material to be called Horoscope, which however developed into an overly complex project and was not released in its original form. Instead, Ferry released another album of re-interpretations in 1993, called Taxi, and re-worked the Horoscope tapes as well as adding new compositions. The result was the highly atmospheric and impressionistic Mamouna album, finally released in 1994, containing nine Ferry originals plus - unprecedentedly - a co-write with Brian Eno, who also performed on the album. Another world tour followed, likewise another delayed release: an album called Alphaville was recorded and produced with Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics, though Ferry eventually chose not to release it. Again, he resolved to re-interpreting other people's songs, this time classic material from the 30s and 40s (including standards by Cole Porter), and the album that ensued was 1999's warm, largely acoustic As Time Goes By. It was presented in live concerts throughout late 1999 and 2000. With more and more Roxy Music tracks being added to the setlist, it was one of the factors finally convincing Ferry to reunite with his former Roxy Music colleagues.

Shortly after the Roxy Music reunion tour, an album called Frantic emerged in 2002, collecting some of the original material planned for Alphaville in the mid-90s, albeit mostly in re-worked form, plus a number of cover versions. The album suggested comparisons to The Bride Stripped Bare, in its more rock-ist, guitar-laden sounds. Not having been inclined to large amounts of touring in earlier years, Ferry undertook another long agenda of live commitments. Only in 2007 did he release his next solo album, a collection of Dylan interpretations - appropriately named Dylanesque -, ranging from introspective, closely-miked ballads to more straightforward rock workouts.

c-block,"
                                        Since producer-driven, vocalist-fronted musical projects such as Snap! and C + C Music Factory had remarkable success in the early 1990s, producers Frank M√ºller, Ulrich Buchmann and J√∂rg Wagner decided to put together such a group in 1995. 

The Persian Gulf War had ended in 1991 and former American soldiers who had decided to remain in Germany were all over the country. Some of them were musicians who hadn't had a chance to capitalize off their talent back home and were willing to try a musical career in Europe. Anthony ""Red Dogg"" Joseph and James ""Mr.P"" White met in such circumstances and were recruited by Frank M√ºller to become part of his newly-created musical project.

They chose the name ""C-Block"" and released their debut single, ""Shake Dat Azz"", a collaboration with Chicago rapper A.k.-s.w.i.f.t. in late 1996, which made a lasting impression on their European fanbase. However, their greatest hits were only ahead of them at the time. ""So Strung Out"", a more rap-oriented single, was released as their sophomore effort and catapulted the group to European superstardom. Based on a Soul Searchers sample, already made famous by Eric B. & Rakim and Run-DMC, called ""Ashley's Roachclip"", ""So Strung Out"" was a soulful ode to drug victims across the world and had a lasting impact in the European rap community.

Unfulfilled plans of a solo career made Mr.P leave the group in late 1997, being replaced by untill then less visible project members Theresa ""Misty"" Baltimore and Preston ""Goldie Gold"" Holloway who had only recorded backing vocals and choruses for the C-Block debut album, ""General Population"", released in 1997. They all quit the project after the more pop-oriented, less successfull second album, ironically called ""Keepin' It Real"". 

Mr.P returned to the group and tried to make a comeback with newly-recruited r&b singer Jeanine Love, but the released singles failed to make an impact comercially or critically and the group officially disbanded in late 2000.

Frank M√ºller, one of the creators and producers of the group, released the group's third, shelved, album in late 2010 on the Internet.

Comprised of two core members, Joey Burns and John Convertino, Calexico became its own entity in 1996 with the release of the Spoke LP. Although that record marked the band‚Äôs first official output, Joey and John had already been playing together as collaborating members of Arizona mainstays Giant Sand. A wide variety of tours, performances (including the Montreux and North Sea Jazz Festivals) and recording sessions as Calexico and with other artists (Neko Case, Victoria Williams, Richard Buckner), as well as their continuing relationship with Giant Sand, allowed the band the opportunity to develop as artists. Over time, Calexico has featured a revolving cast of musicians and instruments, and the band‚Äôs sonic growth can be traced through its varied releases.

camel,"
                                        English progressive rock group formed in 1971 with an original lineup of Andrew Latimer (guitar, flute, vocals), Peter Bardens (keyboards, synths, vocals), Doug Ferguson (bass, vocals) and Andy Ward (drums. percussion).  This lineup recorded the first four studio albums including their most commercially successful album, The Snow Goose, an entirely instrumental record released in 1975.  It peaked at number 22 on the UK charts and is certified silver.

For the tour following the release of the band's fourth album, Moonmadness (1976), they were joined by former King Crimson sax player and flautist Mel Collins.  In early 1977 Ferguson left and was replaced by Richard Sinclair (from Caravan) as the band moved to a jazzier sound.  By  the end of 1978 a series of personnel changes included the departures of Bardens, Sinclair and Collins and the additions of Colin Bass, Kit Watkins and Jan Schelhaas.  Their seventh studio album, ""I Can See Your House From Here"" was problematic for advertisers due to the cover art: a crucified astronaut looking at Earth.  It also marked Camel's return to the UK charts at number 45.  The band had three further studio albums, a live album and numerous personnel changes before disbanding in 1984.

Latimer, the last original member, revived the Camel name in 1991.  With various lineups four more studio albums were recorded by 2002.  The band played a farewell tour in 2003.  It was later disclosed that Latimer was ill and underwent chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant in 2007.  He had recovered sufficiently to revive the band in 2013, recording a new version of The Snow Goose as a tribute to the late Peter Bardens.  The band has toured regularly since 2013 and remains active.

He is also a songwriter, a music producer and composer of romantic pop and rock ballads in the Latino genre. Sesto sang in two pop bands during the 1960s and won a contest in a Madrid TV show. He played a part in the Spanish filming of Shakespeare's Hamlet. Later, he teamed up with singer and producer Juan Pardo, but success would come on its own accord, with his own music works. Camilo Sesto has sold over 175 million albums worldwide, excluding sales of all artists who helped and produced.

As a composer he has written songs for artists such as Miguel Bos√©, Luc√≠a M√©ndez, Charyt√≠n Goyco and Jos√© Jos√©, among others. Camilo produced and translated the lyrics to Spanish of an album from the popular Australian band Air Supply. Throughout his career he remained as one of the most influential pioneer artists of rock/ballad in Spanish, that would inspire many newer acts in the Latino music world.

The band is composed of vocalist Liam Cormier, guitarist Scott Middleton, drummer Mike Peters and bassist Jaye R. Schwarzer. Cancer Bats take a wide variety of influences from heavy metal sub-genres and fuse them into hardcore punk and punk rock. Including elements of sludge metal, and southern rock. The band has also been compared to metalcore bands of the 1990s like Converge and Hatebreed.

Cancer Bats originated in May of 2004 with singer Liam Cormier and guitarist Scott Middleton, former member of Toronto, Canada metal band At The Mercy Of Inspiration. The two wanted to form a project that combined their favorite parts of bands like Refused, Black Flag, Led Zeppelin and Down, among others. The lineup was rounded out with the addition of Andrew McCracken on bass and Joel Bath on drums. The four-piece wrote and recorded songs for a demo self-released in January of 2005.

Soon after, Mike Peters replaced Bath on the drums, and the band began playing shows throughout southern Ontario, playing live shows with bands like Every Time I Die, NORA, Alexisonfire, Haste the Day, It Dies Today, Bane, Comeback Kid, Buried Inside, Attack in Black, Misery Signals and This Is Hell.

On June 2, 2006 the band took part in a short interview and then played a free CD release show at The Edge 102.1 (CFNY-FM). 

On the 6th June 2006 the debut album, Birthing The Giant was released. It was produced by award winning Canadian producer Gavin Brown (Three Days Grace, Billy Talent). On June 7, 2006 they hosted All Things Rock, a show on MTV Canada, and had their own video played at the end of the show.

Summer 2006 they were on tour all across Canada, playing with well-known bands like NOFX and Silverstein. They also played the Rock The Mill festival with other bands such as The Fully Down and Shotgun Rules.

Critical acclaim led to signing licensing deals with Hassle in the UK and Shock in Australia, and to winning the Favourite Hardcore/Metal Group of the year at the 2007 Indie Awards, and Best Independent Video at the 2007 MuchMusic Video Awards

Bass player Andrew McCracken left to concentrate on his design company Doublenaut.

The band's 1986 debut, ""Epicus Doomicus Metallicus"" and it's follow up, 1987's ""Nightfall"" are considered landmark releases by many doom metal fans.  ""Nightfall"" saw vocalist Eddie ""Messiah"" Marcolin join the band.  He would record 2 more studio albums with band before splitting in 1990.  Candlemass continued with vocalist Thomas Vikstr√∂m for one more album before splitting in 1993.  Edling would revive the Candlemass banner for 2 albums in the late 1990s, both recorded with entirely new line-ups.

In 2005, the ""classic"" Candlemass line-up of Edling, Marcolin, drummer Jan Lindh, and gutiarists Lars Johannson and Mats Bj√∂rkman reunited for a brand new, self-titled album.  Relations with Marcolin broke down once again, however, as the band prepared a follow up.  His replacement ended up being an American singer, Robert Lowe, from the band Solitude Aeturnus.

car-seat-headrest,"
                                        Car Seat Headrest is the project of Seattle singersongwriter Will Toledo. With a vision that is both sweeping in scope and intimately personal, Car Seat Headrest embodies the DIY ethos at its best.
Car Seat Headrest began in 2010 in Will‚Äôs hometown of Leesburg, Virginia. Needing a place of solitude (and soundproofing) where he could record his often frantic vocals undisturbed, a 17-year old Will set up shop in the family car (hence the name). From this humble origin, he has since built up a catalogue of staggering breadth and depth. In the last five years there have been over ten releases under the Car Seat Headrest name, one of which exceeds two hours in length.
While the songs of Car Seat Headrest are often long and complex, they are anchored by irresistible melodies and a piercing emotional directness. Dispersed across the globe, the CSH fanbase is the definition of a cult following: several thousand internet denizens who deeply connect with Will‚Äôs intensely honest and unfiltered approach to writing and performing. With the release of Teens of Style, expect that number to greatly expand. This is Car Seat Headrest‚Äôs first release on Matador Records.

                                        Starting out as a three-piece, Carcass were one of Earache Records grindcore flagships. The late BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel declared their first album,""Reek Of Putrefaction,"" was his favorite album of 1988. The 1990 Symphonies Of Sickness tour saw the addition of a second guitarist Mike Amott, formerly of Carnage. 1991's ""Necroticism"" album was the band's first studio work as a four piece. After their fourth album, first to appear on a major commercial label Columbia Records,""Heartwork"", the band proceeded to split up during the recording process of their final album ""Swansong.""

Reformed for live shows in 2007 with Mike Amott back in as second guitarist and Daniel Erlandsson of Arch Enemy as session drummer. Original drummer Ken Owen had suffered a brain hemorrhage and he is hence unable to perform the songs in a live setting, however he retains an active role in the band. Amott and Erlandsson left the band in 2012 to focus on Arch Enemy.

In February 2013 the band announced that after 17 years, a new album was at works. New lineup was announced later in the spring:

carlos-santana,"
                                        American latin-rock group, formed in the late 1960s, led by guitarist Carlos Santana. 
They first came to wide public attention after their performance at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. Their debut promo 45 single for ""Jingo"" properly credits writer as ""Babatunde Olatunji"" and later was mistaken for ""Aaron Copland"". This initial exposure made their first, eponymous album a hit at the time, followed in the next two years by ‚ÄúAbraxas‚Äù and ‚ÄúSantana III‚Äù. 

After three highly acclaimed albums that saw them successfully fuse rock with jazz and Latin music, the band Santana underwent a few changes. Bassist David Brown and percussionist Michael Carabello both left, and during the recording of the fourth album their roles were taken over by various musicians. Meanwhile keyboardist & vocalist Gregg Rolie was starting to fall out with Carlos Santana himself. The end result was a very different album from the first three, not really representing the sound of a unified band. Instead it came across more as a loose jam session between a large cast of musicians, with the band's jazz leanings well to the front, and only three vocal songs among seven instrumentals. It made for a great record, but lacking anything that could be considered for a single release it was unsurprisingly not a commercial success.

Ultimately Caravanserai marked the start of a new chapter in Santana's career, as the band moved away from rock and towards a more experimental and complex sound. Both Gregg Rolie and guitarist Neal Schon left the group after its release - they went on to become founding members of Journey. Over the next few years, lineup changes were common. Although retaining a basis of latin rock, Carlos Santana‚Äôs increasing involvement with guru Sri Chinmoy took the band further into more esoteric music, which continued for many years, although never quite losing the initial latin influence. 

Santana left Columbia in 1991 and signed with Polydor. Though he ended his association with Sri Chimnoy in 1982, he remained intensely spiritual, especially during his live performances. In 1994, he played at the commemorative concert at Woodstock, 25 years after his band's transformative performance at the original festival. In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos Santana, Jose Chepito Areas, David Brown, Mike Carabello, Gregg Rolie and Michael Shrieve being honored.

Santana has achieved a total of eight Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards which were all awarded in 2000. Carlos also won two Grammy Awards as a solo artist in 1989 and 2003. With the 2014 release of Coraz√≥n, Santana surpassed the Rolling Stones and is one of only two music acts in Billboard history to score at least one Top Ten album for six consecutive decades from the 1960s on.  Among other honors, Carlos Santana is #20 on Rolling Stone‚Äôs list of the ‚Äú100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time‚Äù. 

April 15, 2016 marks the release date of Santana IV, the wildly anticipated studio album that reunites the revered early ‚Äô70s lineup. The album signifies the first time in 45 years ‚Äì since 1971‚Äôs multi-platinum classic Santana III ‚Äì that the quintet has recorded together.

In 2007, Caro Emerald was called upon to cut a demo for producers Jan van Wieringen, David Schreurs and Canadian songwriter Vincent Degiorgio. Caro seized the opportunity and recorded ""Back It Up"". When she performed the song on a local Dutch TV station a year later, the song exploded onto the scene. With only one track on the repertoire, David, Vincent, Jan and Caro started working on a full album, inspired by films and music from the 1940s and 1950s. Schreurs and Van Wieringen set up Grandmono Records to release and manage their music, also incorporating Degiorgio's A&R background.

Second single ""A Night Like This"" reached #1 on the Dutch single charts in January 2010. Debut album Deleted Scenes From The Cutting Room Floor was released in the same week, entered the album charts at #1, and reached Platinum status within 6 weeks. Overall, the album spent 30 weeks at #1, breaking a record set by Michael Jackson's Thriller, and sold 260,000 copies within the year in Holland alone. The album has been released in over 40 countries and is IFPI-certified Platinum with sales over 1.3 million in Europe.

Follow-up album The Shocking Miss Emerald was released in May 2013. The lively European arts, entertainment and fashion scene of the 1920s-1960s set the stage for this album, which like Caro's debut album entered the Dutch album charts at #1.

Both Caro's albums were released to popular and critical acclaim and broke various sales records in the Netherlands. Caro and her production team received various awards, including an MTV EMA Award (Best Dutch/Belgian Act), EBBA Award, Goldene Kamera and Echo Award.

                                        Formed in 1992 by Nattefrost (guitar, vocals) and Nordavind (guitar, vocals), when Black Metal was still young and raw the duo soon unleashed the legendary demo tape ""Bloodlust and Perversion"". After the release of the second demo, ""Journey Through the Cold Moors of Svarttjern"", in 1993 they were signed to Avantgarde Music where they released the EP ""Through Chasm, Caves And Titan Woods"" in 1995. After three years of absence the band finally returned with their debut album, ""Black Shining Leather"", which also featured Lars Nedland on drums (under his alias Lazare), in 1998. The album was an instant hit and in 2000 they released their second album, ""Strange Old Brew"", which featured new members Tchort (guitar), Vrangsinn (bass) and Anders Kobro (drums). 

""Morbid Fascination of Death"" was released the following year and Nordavind decided to leave the band. In 2002 they released the compilation album ""We're Going to Hell For This - Over a Decade of Perversions"" which featured covers, live songs, new tracks and a demo track. They also signed a deal with Season of Mist and entered a studio to record a new album. The result was eventually ""Defending the Throne of Evil"" which was released in 2003. A DVD, ""We're Going to Hollywood For This"", followed in 2004 along with a new compilation album, ""Skjend Hans Lik"".

In 2006 they released their latest album ""Fuck You All !!!!"".

Born : October 21, 1925 (for some sources : 1924 or 1929) in Havana, Cuba.
Died : July 16, 2003 in Fort Lee, New Jersey. 

The voice, charisma and talent of Celia Cruz have created one of the most impressive careers in all of music. Merely listing her accomplishments would require a book. Her more than 70 albums have yielded an unending harvest of gold and platinum records, and she has received more than a hundred awards from prestigious institutions around the world. 
She received the first of her five Grammy Awards in 1989, and also won two Latin Grammy Awards. She received three doctorates Honoris Causa from Yale, Florida International University and Miami University. 
Also appearing in 10 movies, most recently including ""The Mambo Kings"" and ""The Perez Family"". 

Celia Cruz began singing in amateur contests at the age of 14, in her home city of Havana, Cuba. She studied music theory, piano and voice at the National Music Conservatory. 

In 1950 she began singing with the conjunto La Sonora Matancera, and with that group she was a central figure in some of the most glorious chapters of Afro-Cuban music, recording a number of legendary songs, including ""Yembe Laroco"", ""Yerbero Moderno"", ""Burundanga"", and ""Caramelo"" by the end of the 1950's La Sonora Matancera was the most popular group in Cuba. Celia's alliance with them took her beyond the coast of Cuba and exported her talent to the world. While in the group she met Pedro Knight, at the time one of the band's two trumpeters. This relationship culminated in matrimony and lasted 42 years.

Born out of the ashes of Hellhammer in 1984, Celtic Frost was started by Tom G. Warrior (aka Thomas G. Fischer, Vocals/Guitar) and Martin Eric Ain (Bass).  Never ones to keep treading the same ground for long, the band progressed from proto-black metal (""Morbid Tales"") to incorporating more classical influences (""To Mega Therion"") and then displaying a more avante-garde streak (""Into The Pandemonium"").  In 1988, Warrior fronted an new line up (drummer Stephen Priestly, who played on ""Morbid Tales"" was the only member besides Warrior to have any previous connect to the band) for ""Cold Lake"".  Criticized as ""glam metal"" by many of the group's fans, the band's creditibilty took a huge hit.  Blame was later assigned to guitarist Oliver Amberg, who composed much of the album in place of an allegedly uninterested Tom G. Warrior.  Martin Eric Ain returned for 1990's ""Vanity/Nemesis"", but the group folded shortly after.

In the early 2000's, Warrior (now calling himself Thomas G. Fischer) and Ain regrouped with guitarist Erol Unala and drummer Franco Sesa.  Fischer and Ain also revived the Prowling Death Records imprint, which had previously been used to issue the Hellhammer demos.  Prowling Death would issue the group's new recordings by licensing them through Century Media, starting with 2006's ""Monotheist"" (although the Prowling Death imprint is not featured on the release).  Erol Unala left the group shortly after the release of ""Monotheist"".

Although there were plans to follow up ""Monotheist"", Thomas G. Fischer announced his departure from Celtic Frost in April 2008, citing ""the irresolvable, severe erosion of the personal basis so urgently required to collaborate within a band so unique, volatile, and ambitious"", although he later stated that his friendship with Ain was still intact.

On September 9, 2008, Martin Eric Ain and Tom G. Fischer announced the definite end of Celtic Frost via the band's official homepage.

While still in high school, she joined the Afro-Arts Theater, a group which toured with Motown great Mary Wells; a few years later, she adopted the African name Chaka Khan while working on the Black Panthers' breakfast program. After quitting high school in 1969, Khan joined the group Lyfe, soon exiting to join another dance band, the Babysitters; neither was on the fast track to success, but her fortunes changed when she teamed with ex-American Breed member Kevin Murphy and Andre Fisher to form Rufus. 
Debuting in 1973 with a self-titled effort on the ABC label, Rufus was among the preeminent funk groups of the decade; distinguished by Khan's dynamic vocals, the group earned half a dozen gold or platinum albums before she went solo in 1978.
Chaka began her solo career with the hit, ""I‚Äôm Every Woman,"" a tune written especially for her by the songwriting team of Ashford & Simpson. Since then, Chaka has recorded nine albums and been honored with five Grammy Awards. Her solo hits include ""What Cha Gonna Do For Me?"" ""Clouds,"" ""Papillion,"" ""I Feel For You,"" and ""Through The Fire.""

Chaplin was a British comedy actor, and one of the most important personalities in the silent film genre. One of his most famous movies is ""The Great Dictator"", a satiric movie about Hitler and the Nazi regime. Chaplin wrote, directed, produced, edited, starred in, and composed the music for most of his films.

Chaplin developed a passion for music as a child, and taught himself to play the piano, violin, and cello. From ""A Woman of Paris"" (1923) onwards he took an increasing interest in the musical accompaniment to his films. With the advent of sound technology, Chaplin began using a synchronised orchestral soundtrack ‚Äì composed by himself ‚Äì for ""City Lights"" (1931). He thereafter composed the scores for all of his films, and from the late 1950's to his death, he scored all of his silent features and some of his short films. Though Chaplin was not a trained musician & he could not read sheet music, and he needed the help of professional composers such as David Raksin, Raymond Rasch & Eric James  when creating his scores, his participation & creative genius in the process could not be denied.

Chaplin's composition  ""Smile"", composed originally for ""Modern Times"" (1936) and later set to lyrics by John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons, was a hit for Nat King Cole in 1954.  For ""Limelight"", Chaplin composed ""Terry's Theme"", which was popularized by Jimmy Young as ""Eternally"" (1952). Finally, ""This Is My Song"", performed by Petula Clark for ""A Countess from Hong Kong"" (1967), reached number one on the UK and other European charts. Chaplin also received his only competitive Oscar for his composition work, as the Limelight theme won an Academy Award for Best Original Score in 1973 following the film's re-release.

As a filmmaker, Chaplin is considered a pioneer and one of the most influential figures of the early twentieth century.

In 1975 he was knighted as a Knight Commander of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II.

                                        The Charlie Daniels Band was formed in 1970, with Charlie Daniels joined by Barry Barnes (guitar), Mark Fitzgerald (bass), Fred Edwards and Gary Allen (drums), and Taz DiGregorio (keyboards). They started recording southern rock-styled albums for Kama Sutra. Although a multi-instrumentalist, Daniels was a limited vocalist, but his voice was well suited to the talking-style ""Uneasy Rider"", which reached the US Top 10 in 1973. He followed it with his anthem for southern rock, ""The South's Gonna Do It"". In 1974, Daniels had members of The Marshall Tucker Band and The Allman Brothers Band join him onstage in Nashville. It was so successful that he decided to make his so-called Volunteer Jam an annual event. It led to some unlikely combinations of artists such as James Brown performing with Roy Acuff, and the stylistic mergers have included Crystal Gayle singing the blues with the Charlie Daniels Band.

The Charlie Daniels Band underwent some personnel changes on 1975's Nightrider, with Tom Crain, Charlie Hayward and Don Murray replacing Barnes, Fitzgerald and Allen respectively. When Daniels moved to Epic in 1976, there was a concerted effort to turn the band into a major concert attraction, despite the fact that at 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighing 20 stone Daniels was no teenage idol: he hid his face under an oversized cowboy hat. The albums sold well, and in 1979, when recording his Million Mile Reflections album, he recalled a 20s poem, ""The Mountain Whipporwill"", by Stephen Vincent Benet. The band developed this into ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"", in which Johnny outplays the Devil to win a gold fiddle. Daniels overdubbed his fiddle seven times to create an atmospheric recording that topped the US country charts and reached number 3 in the US pop charts. It was also a UK Top 20 success.

In 1980 the band recorded ""In America"" for the hostages in Iran, and then in 1982, ""Still In Saigon"" , about Vietnam. The band were featured on the soundtrack for Urban Cowboy and also recorded the theme for the Burt Reynolds movie Stroker Ace. The 13th Volunteer Jam was held in 1987, but financial and time constraints meant the event was put on temporary hiatus (it resumed four years later). In the late 80s Daniels appeared in the movie Lone Star Kid and published a book of short stories, but continued touring and playing his southern boogie to adoring audiences.

During the 90s Daniels updated ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"" with Johnny Cash and continued in his politically incorrect way - in simple language, he advocates both lynching and red-baiting; not a man to stand next to at the bar. He signed a new recording contract with Liberty in 1993, but also targeted the white gospel market through a deal with Sparrow Records. The albums The Door and Steel Witness earned Daniels several awards from the Christian recording community. In 1997 Daniels inaugurated his own Blue Hat Records and also released his first children's album, By The Light Of The Moon: Campfire Songs & Cowboy Tunes, on the Sony Wonder label. Two years later he took his Volunteer Jam event on the road for the first time.

                                        The Charlie Daniels Band was formed in 1970, with Charlie Daniels joined by Barry Barnes (guitar), Mark Fitzgerald (bass), Fred Edwards and Gary Allen (drums), and Taz DiGregorio (keyboards). They started recording southern rock-styled albums for Kama Sutra. Although a multi-instrumentalist, Daniels was a limited vocalist, but his voice was well suited to the talking-style ""Uneasy Rider"", which reached the US Top 10 in 1973. He followed it with his anthem for southern rock, ""The South's Gonna Do It"". In 1974, Daniels had members of The Marshall Tucker Band and The Allman Brothers Band join him onstage in Nashville. It was so successful that he decided to make his so-called Volunteer Jam an annual event. It led to some unlikely combinations of artists such as James Brown performing with Roy Acuff, and the stylistic mergers have included Crystal Gayle singing the blues with the Charlie Daniels Band.

The Charlie Daniels Band underwent some personnel changes on 1975's Nightrider, with Tom Crain, Charlie Hayward and Don Murray replacing Barnes, Fitzgerald and Allen respectively. When Daniels moved to Epic in 1976, there was a concerted effort to turn the band into a major concert attraction, despite the fact that at 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighing 20 stone Daniels was no teenage idol: he hid his face under an oversized cowboy hat. The albums sold well, and in 1979, when recording his Million Mile Reflections album, he recalled a 20s poem, ""The Mountain Whipporwill"", by Stephen Vincent Benet. The band developed this into ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"", in which Johnny outplays the Devil to win a gold fiddle.

                                        Charles Otto Puth Jr. (born December 2, 1991) is an American singer, songwriter and record producer. His initial exposure came through the viral success of his song videos uploaded to YouTube.

After initially signing with eleveneleven after performing on The Ellen Degeneres Show, Puth began contributing to songs and albums for other artists such as Pitbull, Livingston Taylor and Skizzy Mars, and creating lite solo material. With intent on a solo career, Atlantic Records sought the artist and released his debut single, ""Marvin Gaye"" featuring Meghan Trainor in 2015 to unanimous success. His first feature, ""See You Again"" was released later that year, which he co-wrote, co-produced, and performed with Wiz Khalifa for the Furious 7 soundtrack as a tribute to Paul Walker. It peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 for 12 non-consecutive weeks. After the success of ""See You Again"", he gained worldwide recognition for multiple subsequent releases, including his next single ""One Call Away"". The single reached number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100, and topped charts in New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland, and the United Kingdom.

Puth's debut studio album, Nine Track Mind, was released in January 2016, and was preceded by the singles ""One Call Away"" and ""We Don't Talk Anymore"", which peaked at number 12 and number nine, respectively on the US Billboard Hot 100. In 2017, he released two songs, ""Attention"" and ""How Long"" from his second studio album, Voicenotes, with the former peaking at number four on Billboard Hot 100.

They became a success with their self-titled debut, in which they started off their defining sound; the catchiness of The Beatles with the speed and energy of Punk rock. The Los Angeles Times proclaimed: ""Cheap Trick gained fame by twisting the Beatlesque into something shinier, harder, more American."" 
They have often been referred to in the Japanese press as the ""American Beatles"".

Most known for their tracks ""Surrender"", ""I Want You To Want Me"", ""Dream Police"" and ""The Flame"" - and did a cover of Big Star's ""In The Street"" for American sitcom That 70's Show (season 2 onwards) and also the theme tune to the American satirical late night television program The Colbert Report.

Surprisingly, for the age of the band the line-up hasn't changed a great deal. Also the Illinois State Senate has declared 1st April to be ""Cheap Trick Day"".  They also took the 25th spot in VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.

chumbawamba,"
                                        This anarchist pop punk band is probably best known for the single ""Tubthumping"", which was everywhere in 1997, but probably less well known is the fact that this was taken from their eighth studio album, ""Tubthumper"". 

Formed in a squat in Leeds, England, in 1982, Chumbawamba released their first single, ""Revolution"", in 1985. Their musical style has changed through the years, initially a shouting punk band, later recording some folk songs, then, with the ""Jesus H Christ"" album, they discovered electronic music. 

That album, however, was built around numerous samples of other groups and, when they found out how much clearing them would cost, they scrapped it (though, it was released as a bootleg and, in recent years, via their chumbawamba.tv site as mp3s) and rerecorded the album without the samples and with a new focus on censorship. 

""Anarchy"" was their response to criticism from their contemporaries for their move into pop music, funny, political and musically experimental. The anti-Nazi song ""Enough is Enough"", recorded with regular collaborator MC Fusion, was released as a single and launched Fusion's new group Credit to the Nation. They had minor chart success, but nothing compared to what was to come. 

The disappointing ""Swingin' with Raymond"" followed and was the end of their relationship with One Little Indian. Deciding that there's no such thing as a good capitalist, big or small, they signed with EMI, whom they had criticised in the past. The band were heavily criticised once again, but the massive worldwide success of ""Tubthumper"" allowed the band to fund numerous political campaigns around the world. 

They were never to repeat the success of that single and proudly proclaimed themselves one hit wonders and their relationship with EMI only lasted one more album and a few singles. Independent again with Mutt Records, and with long-time producer Neil Ferguson now officially a member, they have continued to experiment with their style, recording ""Readymades"", mixing folk samples with dance beats, the soundtrack to the Alex Cox film ""Revengers Tragedy"" and their latest release, ""UN"", recorded on a mini disc in Latin America and at Chumbawamba's Bradford studio, mixing styles and sounds from different parts of the world.

Since then, the group slimmed down to just Lou, Neil, Boff and Jude, and added Phil Moody on accordion to play folk music with pop influences. The other members have moved on to their own projects.  

Always controversial, often under attack from the left and the right, Chumbawamba have always done things their own way and, in their own words, ""Never do what you are told."" 

In August 2012 the band decided to call it quits after some final gigs in their 30th year of existence mainly because ""the rest of our lives got in the way and we couldn‚Äôt commit the time and enthusiasm that the band demanded.""

A product of the No-Wave music scene of the late 1970s, the group had their roots in abrasive, experimental music, with Moore and Ranaldo having previously worked with the experimental composer Glenn Branca. The band were joined in 1985 by drummer Steve Shelley, and recorded 15 albums together, as well as many side and solo projects. Their work has been consistently challenging and innovative, and they are widely regarded as one of the most intriguing and influential bands of their time. This view has been added to by the strength of their record ""Sonic Nurse"", which also featured the talents of Jim O'Rourke.  O'Rourke left the band in 2005.  In 2006, Mark Ibold joined the group.

In September 2011, Sonic Youth went on ""indefinite hiatus"" following the separation of Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore (the couple had been married since 1984).

                                        The Circle Jerks are an American punk rock band formed in 1979 by vocalist Keith Morris and guitarist Greg Hetson.  Morris had previously been a vocalist for Black Flag and Hetson had been a guitarist for Red Cross (later known as Redd Kross).  Both bands practiced at a rehearsal space called The Church, located in Hermosa Beach, California.  Morris and Hetson quit their bands at about the same time, but for opposite reasons:  Morris felt Black Flag practiced too much and Hetson felt Red Cross didn't practice enough.  The duo recruit jazz-trained drummer Keith ""Lucky"" Lehrer as their drummer.  Lehrer had auditioned for Red Cross but had been rejected by the other members of the band for allegedly being ""too good"", much to Hetson's frustration (Red Cross's previous drummer, Ron Reyes, ended up replacing Morris in Black Flag).  Bassist Roger Rogerson (born Roger Dowding) was the final addition to the band.  The Circle Jerks quickly rose in popularity due to their hyperspeed music and energetic performances, but their habit of re-using music and lyrics from their previous groups (sometimes including bits that the members of the Circle Jerks did not author) did not win them many friends amongst their former bandmates.   Their debut release, 1980's ""Group Sex"" featured 14 songs in 16 minutes and is considered a classic.  

During the recording of their 3rd LP, ""Golden Shower Of Hits"", Lucky Lehrer was fired from the group because his enrollment in law school was seen as an obstacle for the band's plans.  Drummer John Ingram completed the album.  The band then recruited drummer Chuck Biscuits (formerly of D.O.A. and Black Flag) and bassist Earl Liberty (formerly of Saccharine Trust), with Rogerson temporarily playing 2nd guitar before leaving the band in the midst of a tour.  This line up toured into 1984 and made a cameo in the movie ""Repo Man"" before the rhythm section departed.  1985's ""Wonderful"" featured bassist Zander Schloss (who also had a role in ""Repo Man"") and drummer Keith ""Adolph"" Clark.  This line up also recorded the band's 5th LP, the oddly named ""VI"" in 1987. The band toured for the next few years but by this time Hetson had joined Bad Religion, which occupied more of his time, and by 1990 the Circle Jerks ceased activity.

In 1994 Morris, Hetson, Schloss, and Clark reunited and recorded ""Oddities, Abnormalities, and Curiosities"" and toured into 1995 before again calling it quits.  Around this time, Lehrer and Rogerson approached Morris and Hetson about reuniting the original line up but Morris later stated that he and Hetson had no intentions of pursuing that action.  In 1996, Rogerson died from a heroin overdose.  In 2001, Morris, Hetson, and Schloss reunited again, this time with new drummer Kevin Fitzgerald.  This line up made numerous live appearances.  In 2010, the group attempted to record new material with producer Dmitri Coats.  Morris soon found himself at odds with the rest of the group over the choice of producer, who was working closely with Morris but rejecting much of the material submitted by the rest of the band.  The group opted to fire Coats so Morris quit the group and formed OFF! with Coats, leaving the Circle Jerks in a state of hiatus.

clawfinger,"
                                        Metal band from Stockholm, Sweden.

Formed in 1990 by four co-workers at the Rosenlund hospital, Clawfinger comprised of Jocke Skog (b. 3 June 1969, Stockholm, Sweden; programming, vocals), Zak Tell (b. 16 November 1970, Stockholm, Sweden; vocals), Erlend Ottem (b. 13 December 1968, Molde, Norway; guitar) and B√•rd Torstensen (b. 13 September 1961, Arendal, Norway; guitar). They immediately received international praise for their fluid but powerful alternative rock sound. Their debut single, 1993's ""Nigger"", also provoked great controversy. Although the subject matter was profoundly anti-racist, many critics wondered as to the wisdom of its title. The media quickly categorized Clawfinger alongside American outfits such as Rage Against The Machine, who similarly combined political activism with a musical scope that ranged from hardcore rap to metal. The band's debut album, Deaf Dumb Blind, expanded their repertoire to encompass funk and even jazz flourishes. It was promoted in the USA on tours with Anthrax and Alice In Chains, while Clawfinger remained rooted in their national charts with a joint EP with Swedish rappers Just D. In 1995 the band, now expanded to a six-piece with the addition of Andr√© Skaug (b. Sunndals√∏ra, Norway; bass) and Ottar Vigerst√∏l (drums), launched their ""Back To The Basic"" European tour, which saw them play in 12 European countries within a few weeks.

The band took a break before starting work on their self-titled third album, which featured session drummer Henka Johansson (b. Karlskoga, Sweden). Johansson was later added to the line-up as the band embarked on an extensive tour. Their fourth album, A Whole Lot Of Nothing, was released in 2001 followed by Zeroes & Heros in 2003.

cliff-richard,"
                                        Born October 14, 1940, Lucknow, India to British parents. 

Britain's most successful home-grown pop star, he has had more than 130 singles, albums and EP's make the UK Top 20, more than any other artist.  He has achieved 14 UK number one singles (or 18, depending on the counting methodology). He holds the record (with Elvis Presley) as the only act to make the UK singles charts in all of its first six decades (1950's‚Äì2000's). 

He was backed in the 1950's by The Drifters, who later changed their name to The Shadows.

Richard first came to fame in 1958 with his debut disc ""Move It"", a rock 'n' roll number in the Elvis Presley mould. However, like Elvis himself, Cliff's output quickly settled down into a string of inoffensive, largely middle-of-the-road recordings, while his squeaky clean, teen-heart-throb image was put to use in a series of exuberant, innocent, and thinly-plotted film musicals including ""The Young Ones"" (1962) and ""Summer Holiday"" (1963).

The late 1970's saw him surprisingly re-invented as a mildly-heavy rocker, and he finally achieved the US recognition that had eluded him for so long when ""Devil Woman"" reached the top ten there. In 1979 he released ""We Don't Talk Anymore"", which became his biggest-selling single worldwide, and more hits followed. In 1983, he marked his 25th anniversary in the business with a retrospective album ""Silver"" and new material in unusual styles. In late 2013, he released his 100th album, ""The Fabulous Rock 'N' Roll Songbook"".

In 1987 they had the unique opportunity to open the Marktrock festival in Leuven (Belgium). After their performance, music publisher Hans Kusters decides to make the first Clouseau single, titled ""Brandweer"", which was sold 427 times.

During the years after their first single, Clouseau quickly became one of the most famous bands in Flanders, singing mostly in Dutch. The band also recorded two albums in English (in 1991 and 1993). In 1997 all band members except the two brothers left the band and Koen and Kris continued with Clouseau on their own.

Currently, the band consists of Koen Wauters (vocals), Kris Wauters (piano, acoustic guitar, backing vocals).
On stage they are accompagnied by freelance musicians : Herman Cambr√© (drums), Vincent Pierins (bass), Frank Michiels (percussion), Eric Melaerts (guitar), Tom Van Stiphout (guitar) and Hans Francken (keyboards).

Coal Chamber are led by gruff vocalist Dez Fafara and operate in territory somewhere between the traditional hard riffing of Black Sabbath and the sensationalist techno rock of Marilyn Manson. Fafara met guitarist Miguel ""Meegs' Rascon through a classified ad, and they later added drummer Mike Cox and bass player Rayna Foss, the room-mate of Fafara's future wife.

They signed to Roadrunner Records in 1995 after being recommended by Dino Cazares of Fear Factory, and received widespread exposure in the metal press as that label's hottest new property since Machine Head. Their debut attained further strong reviews.
Their sophomore set, 1999's Chamber Music, was boosted by the inclusion of their highly popular cover version of Peter Gabriel's ""Shock The Monkey"", featuring Ozzy Osbourne on vocals. Foss, who gave birth to her daughter by Morgan Rose of Sevendust the same year, was temporarily replaced by Nadja Peulen. The arrangement became permanent in 2002. The band was further unsettled when Cox departed the same September. Coal Chamber split in 2003.

In late 2011 it was announced that Coal Chamber would be reformed.

Died : April 17, 1960 //    Chippenham, Wiltshire, UK 
An extraordinarily talented guitarist, singer and songwriter of the rock and roll era. His music influenced later artists such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who and many others.

Cochran's parents moved from Oklahoma City to Albert Lea, Minnesota, where he was born. The family moved back to Oklahoma briefly, before finally settling in Bell Gardens, LA, California.

As an LA teenager Cochran became a talented musician, with a circle of friends that included Connie 'Guybo' Smith- who's nickname would later become one of his song titles. Influenced by the works of Merle Haggard & Hank Williams he teamed up with Hank Cochran (unrelated), playing dance halls, fairs and schools as they were too young to play in 'redneck bars'.

They later called themselves The Cochran Brothers, touring the south-western states and appearing on the 'California Hayride' show. They recorded two 'hillbilly' records with Ekko Records in 1955 and did a promotional tour, meeting Elvis Presley on the Dallas 'Big D Jamboree' show. The duo auditioned for Sun Records in Memphis but split up shortly after making ""Fool's Paradise""- their third recording on Ekko- a song that shows a strong Presley influence, assisted by the co-writing of Jerry Capehart.

In 1956 Cochrane teamed up with Capehart and was signed to Liberty in 1957, although he still appeared on the labels of friends Capehart and Sylvester Cross- spending time in LA's Gold Star studio producing, writing and recording backing vocals on labels such as Crest, Zephyr, Crash, Vik, along with Silver, on which he recorded ""Guybo""- also known as 'Drum City'. He also appeared in two films.

Following up on his increasing American success Cochran toured the UK in 1960, joining up with Gene Vincent and Ronnie Hawkins to appear on popular TV & radio shows and the concert hall circuit. His girlfriend, songwriter Sharon Shari Sheeley, later joined them. The tour was a resounding success.

On Sunday 17th April - the day following the tour- Cochran, Vincent and Sheeley were on their way to the airport to return to the United States in the back seat of a car (also occupied by deputy tour manager Patrick Tompkins in the front seat), driven by hired taxi-driver George Martin. The vehicle left the road and hit a lampost. Sheeley suffered a broken pelvis but managed to fully recover. Vincent suffered broken ribs & collarbone and sustained injuries to an already weak leg that left him with a limp for the rest of his life. Cochran died in hospital that day from severe head injuries aged 21. 

Eerily, Cochran had just released a single, co-written with brother Bob Cochran, entitled ""Three Steps to Heaven."" It reached No. 1 in the charts, helping rock 'n roll come of age in the UK.

Inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 (Performer).

conway-twitty,"
                                        American Country singing star who started out singing rock & roll.

Originally a '50s rock & roll singer, Conway Twitty became the reigning country superstar of the '70s and '80s, racking up a record 40 number one hits over the course of two decades. With his deep, resonant down-home voice, Twitty was one of the smoothest balladeers to work in Nashville during the country-pop era, but he was also one of the most adventurous. More than any other singer, he was responsible for selling country as an ""adult"" music, slipping sexually suggestive lyrics into his lush productions, yet never singing misogynist lyrics; by and large, his songs were sensitive and sensual, which is part of the reason why he achieved such a large success. Once Twitty reached the top of the country charts in the late '60s, he stayed there for years on end, releasing a consistent stream of Top Ten hits that both defined and expanded the limitations of country-pop by adding subtle R&B, pop, and rock & roll influences. Though he had some pop success, Twitty remained country to the core; occasionally, his song titles were simply too corny, which was why he retained his popularity until his death in 1993, aged 59.

                                        Born: May 5, 1981, Southampton, Hampshire, England

Soulful vocalist whose early releases were a defining factor in the UK garage sound. More recently he has been moving towards a standard RNB style.

David was born in Holyrood, Southampton, Hampshire, the son of Tina (n√©e Loftus), a retail assistant at Superdrug, and George David, a carpenter. David's father is a Grenadian and David's mother is an English Jew related to the founders of the Accurist watch-making company; David's maternal grandfather was an Orthodox Jew and his maternal grandmother a convert to Judaism. David's parents separated when he was eight and he was raised by his mother. He attended Bellemoor School.
David's father played bass in a reggae band called Ebony Rockers. As a teen, David began accompanying his father to local dance clubs, where DJs let him take the microphone.

David's earliest exposure came when he worked on a b-side to British group Damage's cover of ""Wonderful Tonight"". He then started doing vocals for a few tracks with garage act Artful Dodger. The song ""Re-Rewind"", from the Artful Dodger album It's All About the Stragglers, hit Number 2 on the UK charts in 1999; thus, paving the way for a solo career. David's first single, ""Fill Me In"", released on Colin Lester's and Ian McAndrew's Wildstar Records made him the youngest solo male artist ever to reach Number 1 in the United Kingdom (he was 18 years old at the time). This was the first of a string of four Top 10 singles from his debut album Born To Do It, which eventually sold more than seven million units worldwide, earning multi-platinum status in more than 20 countries. The song ""Key To My Heart"", taken from the US version of the album, was also featured on the award-winning Warner Brothers animated film Osmosis Jones.

                                        Creedence Clearwater Revival (often known as ""CCR"") were an American rock band, active 1967‚Äì1972, formed by John Fogerty (Vocals And Guitar), Tom Fogerty (Rhythm Guitar), Stu Cook (Bass), and Doug ""Cosmo"" Clifford (Drums).  Despite being from San Francisco, California, the band's music usually invoked imagery of the American South.

John Fogerty, Stu Cook, and Doug Clifford initially joined forces in 1959 as The Blue Velvets and later backed John's older brother, Tom, as Tommy Fogerty and the Blue Velvets.  The group later changed their name to the Golliwogs and released several unsuccesful singles.  In 1967, they changed their name to Creedence Clearwater Revival and John Fogerty took total control of the group.  CCR was extremely prolific, releasing 6 albums and various singles between 1968 and 1970.  However, the other members of the band chafed under John Fogerty's domination and in 1971 it was announced that Tom Fogerty had left the band.  CCR made one more album, 1972's ""Mardi Gras"", as a trio.  In the wake of Tom's departure, John, responding the other members' requests to have more say in band matters, stipulated that both Cook and Clifford had to contribute equally to the writing and recording.  The album was poorly received and CCR subsequently split.

In the years following their split, the animosties between John and the other members grew.  When the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame in 1993, John infamously barred Cook and Clifford from the stage (Tom had passed away in 1990).  In 1995, Cook and Clifford formed Creedence Clearwater Revisited.

The group added singer and club DJ Tony Byroads. The resulting quartet renamed itself Sugardaddy Superstar. While building up a local following, the band recorded in its own Sugarstar Studio. It first gained recognition beyond its region when it attracted the interest of the Los Angeles A&R company Taxi and Los Angeles promoter Chris Long (who took over as manager), leading to an L.A. showcase in March 2002. That, in turn, led to a signing to the Earshot subsidiary of Columbia Records early the next year. The band then retooled its self-released album, Cold, under the auspices of mixer/engineer Randy Staub and renamed itself Crossfade. In April 2004 James Branham replaced Geiger behind the drum kit.

                                        Alternative Rock (Modern Rock) band from USA.

The band formed by guitarist/composer Jun Senoue, singer/songwriter Johnny Gioeli, and a rotating lineup of several bassists (Takeshi Taneda, Naoto Shibata) and drummers (Toru Kawamura, Kirita Katsuji) in 2001, mainly known for performing songs for the Sonic the Hedgehog series.

Crush 40 was originally named Sons of Angels in 2000 for their debut album ""Thrill of the Feel"", the soundtrack to NASCAR Rubbin' Racin', but changed their name to Crush 40 when the Norwegian group of the same name reunited in 2001. After renaming themselves to Crush 40, they re-released their debut album, minus the instrumental tracks, as an eponymous album in 2004. From 2001 onward they did theme songs for each major Sonic the Hedgehog game, from Sonic Adventure 2 all the way up to 2009's Sonic and the Black Knight; also in 2009 they released the compilation album ""The Best of Crush 40: Super Sonic Songs"", which was their first album to feature songs that were not game-related. However, after 2009 their influence began to wane heavily, and the last Sonic the Hedgehog game they made music for was Sonic Free Riders in 2010.

In 2012 Crush 40 released an EP, ""Rise Again"", which contained the charity single ""Song of Hope"" that was made for the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and ""Live!"", Crush 40's first live album, recorded in Japan.

cryptopsy,"
                                        Formed in Canada, 1992, the band started out with the name Necrosis but soon changed it to Cryptopsy. The first and only demo was called ""Ungentle Exhumation"" and was released in the following year. In 1994 their first full-length was released, ""Blasphemy Made Flesh"", and it gained them succes and a good reputation in the underground. In 1996 they released the classic ""None So Vile"" which was a huge succes and surpassed other bands in terms of brutality. Sadly, Lord Worm left the band after the release. Michael DiSalvo (Infestation) later joined the band and he was the perfect replacement. After an impressive live show at the Milwaukee Metal Festival the band were signed to Century Media Records. 

With a new frontman and a record deal, the band recorded ""Whisper Supremacy"" which was released in 1998. They went on tours around the world and sales were up to 50,000 copies. Cryptopsy was becoming bigger and bigger and more live shows where played including the Dynamo Festival in Holland and several shows in Japan. 

After a wealth of tours the band returned to the studio and recorded ""And Then You'll Beg"" which was released in 2000. In August 2001, vocalist Michael DiSalvo was replaced by Martin Lacroix. In 2003 they released the live album, ""None So Live"", which was the last to feature Martin Lacroix as he left the band shortly after. His replacement was none other than the original vocalist, Lord Worm. In 2005, they recorded a new studio album entitled ""Once Was Not"". 

In 2008, ""The Unspoken King"" album marks the debut of Matt McGachy as well as the first and only appearance on a Cryptopsy album by Maggie Durand, as well as the band's departure from the death metal genre. The band instead perform deathcore on this album. 

After being on a record label for their entire career, Cryptopsy decided to go independent in 2012. Cryptopsy released independently the eponymous album on September 14, 2012. The album marked a return to their technical death metal sound.

In 2015, rather than a full album, Cryptopsy released the first instalment (Tome 1) of a series of EPs entitled The Book of Suffering. The band has said that The Book of Suffering Tome 1 is some of the most brutal, dark and technical music they have ever created.

dan-hartman,"
                                        Dan Hartman was born December 8, 1950 in Harrisburg, PA, he died March 22, 1994 in Westport, CT.
He was a prolific writer who honed his craft with a spate of non hit songs until he was asked to join the influential Johnny Winter Band as a backing musician, and then moved on to Johnny's brother Edgar Winter Group where he played bass and was given a free hand to participate in their monster collaboration ""They Only Come Out At Night"", a glam rock affair that defined the new rock ethos with the #1 pop hit ""Frankenstein"" and then he sang lead on ""Free Ride"" in 1972. He continued to flourish, learning more instruments and then went solo in 1976, his label issuing ""Who Is Dan Hartman and Why Is Everyone Saying Wonderful Things About Him?"", a promotional compilation of his tunes recorded with the Winters brothers. Soon, the brothers Winter were backing Hartman on his first true solo release, ""Images"" which introduced elements of Soul and R&B to his rapidly expanding repertoire. Keeping his toe in the rock arena, he recorded the Muddy Waters LP ""I'm Ready"" spending most of the time in the producers chair and adding a new sound to the blues legend repertoire. Hartman's songs usually had a steady beat, and in 1978 he released ""Instant Replay"" of which the title tune went to #1 disco (#29 pop), but contained a wide variety of sounds and beats that set the scene for his ""Relight My Fire"" LP in 1979. The centrepiece was ""Vertigo/Relight My Fire"", which spent 6 energy fuelled weeks at #1 US disco.

In 1981 Dan released ""It Hurts To Be In Love"" - an album which had moved away from the disco sound with melodic and almost Country Music tones. 

Success returned in 1984 with Dan's collaboration with Charlie Midnight and the release of ""I Can Dream About You"" from the film soundtrack of ""Streets of Fire"".  ""We are the Young"" and ""Second Nature"" were subsequently released from the album but did not make a big impression on the UK charts. In 1985 his song ""Get Outta Town"", from the Chevy Chase movie ""Fletch"" was released as a single and was included on the soundtrack album. Pressings of the UK only 12"" single included M&M mixes of ""I Can Dream About You"" but failed to ignite. Hartman and Midnight then collaborated on James Brown's ""Living In America"" that peaked at #3 dance and #4 US Pop in 1986. In 1989, he released his final LP, ""New Green Clear Blue"" a total departure from his pop influenced music with a foray into the ""New Age"" instrumental music. 

After being diagnosed with HIV, Dan's last major production projects included tracks for Tina Turner, Dusty Springfield, Joe Cocker, Bonnie Tyler, Paul Young, James Brown, Nona Hendryx, Holly Johnson, Living in a Box, the Plasmatics and Steve Winwood. He died, in 1994 from an AIDS related brain tumour just as his music was experiencing a revival.  Dance groups like Black Box used Loleatta Holloway's Dan Hartman produced voice sample on their huge hit  'Ride On Time', and then Take That recorded their own version of  ""Relight My Fire"" with Lulu in October 1993 that went to #1 in the UK. Hartman was secretive about his sexuality and HIV status, preferring to keep his private life to himself. Since his death, his songs ""I Can Dream About You"" and ""Relight My Fire"" were cleared for use in the Grand Theft Auto video games that brought his music to a new audience.

                                        Danzig is an American heavy metal band formed in 1987, morphing out of the goth/punk/metal band Samhain.  The band was conceived after vocalist Glenn Danzig was introduced to producer Rick Rubin following a Samhain show.  Rubin was interested in working with Glenn but not Samhain so the duo set about forming a new group.  Glenn insisted upon retaining the services of Samhain bassist Eerie Von.  Guitarist John Christ, who had briefly served as Samhain's final guitarist, was also brought on board and, at Danzig's request, Rubin secured the services of veteran punk rock drummer Chuck Biscuits. 

The first 3 Danzig albums displayed a heavy, blues-influenced heavy metal sound and were well-received by fans and critics.  In 1993, the band scored a major hit with the release of the single for the song ""Mother"", which initially appeared their 1988 debut.  The band's fourth release, 1994's ""4p"", showed the band moving away from their bluesier roots and adding more electronic elements.  Biscuits left the band prior to its release and Von and Christ departed after the tour for the album.  Danzig later claimed that it had been his intent from the beginning to work with different musicians in a style similar to Ozzy Osbourne, although some of the other original members have contended that Danzig was started as a band and not a solo vehicle for Glenn.  Now also at odds with Rubin and his label, Danzig departed for Hollywood Records.  With a new band and a new label, Danzig released ""Danzig 5:  Blackaciddevil"" in 1996.  The album featured a heavy industrial sound that was not received well by fans or critics.  The situation was further complicated as Hollywood's parent company, Disney, was uncomfortable with their association with Danzig and pulled all support for the release.  The label and band severed ties shortly afterwards.

Danzig continued with a revolving door of backing players joining Glenn.  After the release of ""Danzig 6:66 Satan's Child"" in 1999, the band abandoned the industrial influences and began to return to a more hard rock/heavy metal sound, although they have not recaptured the same commercial and critical acclaim that the early Danzig records have had.  In recent years, Glenn has voiced his dissatisfaction with long tours and has mentioned the possibility of retiring the Danzig band if he cannot pursue music the way he wants to.

In 1996, Glenn Danzig created the Evilive label to distribute his music.

As a highly intelligent student, Bobby Darin dropped out of college and changed his name to 'Bobby Darin' to set out in pursuit of his musical ambitions. During the late 1950s, his first well-known hit ""Splish Splash"" was released, quickly followed by ""Dream Lover"" and the unforgettable ""Mack The Knife"". In 1960 he also began acting in movies and by the early 1970's he had his own television show. Sadly, as a result of multiple bouts with rheumatic fever during his childhood he was left with a damaged heart. This ultimately caught up with him, causing Darin to pass away at the age of 37 on December 20, 1973. He was revered by Dick Clark as one of the greatest entertainers to have lived, and has a discography to prove it.

                                        Black metal band from Stockholm, Sweden, founded by guitarists Lord Ahriman (Mikael Svanberg) and Blackmoon (David Parland) in 1993. They were later joined by Draugen (Joel Andersson) and Themgoroth (Paul M√§kitalo) and eventually recorded their self-titled and self-financed debut album at Uni-Sound studio, released on the 4th of May, the day the band also played their very first gig. After the release, Draugen left the band and was replaced by Equimanthorn. The band was signed to No Fashion Records in 1995 and switched to Abyss Studio. For their first own tour, Emperor Magus Caligula (Magnus Broberg) (original vocalist of Hypocrisy) joined the band as vocalist and became a permanent member. 

In 1996, Dark Funeral released their second full-length album, ""The Secrets of the Black Arts"" which was well-received and enabled the band to get deals with Metal Blade Records (North America) and Mystic Production (Poland). Following the contracts, vocalist Themgoroth and drummer Equimanthorn left the band along with co-founding member Blackmoon. Alzazmon (Tomas Asklund) was recruited as the new drummer. 

The band went on the first round of the ""Satanic War Tour"" throughout Europe together with Necromass in 1996, followed in 1997 by a second round with Ancient and Bal-Sagoth as support. After appearing on ""The American Satanic Crusade Tour"" with Usurper as support, the band returned to Sweden to record the album ""Vobiscum Satanas"". 

In 1998, Dominion (Matti M√§kel√§), joined as session bass player as Dark Funeral played at the ""The Ineffable Kings of Darkness"" Tour with Enthroned and Liar Of Golgotha, as well as appearing at the Swedish Hultsfred Festival. After the tour, Typhos (Henrik Ekeroth) was replaced by Dominion as the bands second guitarist, with Emperor Magus Caligula picking up the bass. Alzazmon also left the band, and the band's long time friend Gaahnfaust (Robert Lundin) replaced him as drummer. The following year meant even more touring, playing the ""Black Plague Across the West"" tour in Mexico and America, as well as ""The Satanic Inquisition"" tour with Dimmu Borgir. 

The EP ""Teach the Children to Worship Satan"" was released in 2000, recorded at the Abyss studio. Following the ""No Mercy"" festival tour with Deicide, Immortal and Cannibal Corpse, Gaahnfaus left the band, with Matte Modin (Defleshed) taking his place. He made his debut at the ""With Full Force"" festival. In 2001, they once again entered Abyss Studio to record ""Diabolis Interium"". ""Under the Wings of Hell"" split EP, with Swedish Infernal, came in 2002 and in 2004 the live album ""De Profundis Clamavi Ad Te Domine"" was released.

Owner of the label EnMass Music.

His career in music started back in school when he used his PC to wile away his hours making happy hardcore tunes, however the limits of the PC 10000 Maniacs soon started to frustrate Ville and he moved onto creating sounds in the studio.

At a pre-party at his friend's house, Ville played ""Rude Boy"" by Swedish singer Leila K several times in a row which lead to his friends calling him 'Rude Boy', which he started using as his nickname online and when making music. 'Rudeboy' was shortened 'The Rude' and finally 'Da Rude', which was further combined 'Darude' for the logo when the first single 'Sandstorm' was released.

Unlike many other dance music producers, Darude doesn't have a DJ background, though he DJs regularly these days. Before he started producing music, he was really into listening to music and going clubbing and that's where his ""education"" and wide taste in music comes from. His musical career took off, when he gave Finnish producer Jaakko Salovaara (JS16) a demo CD with 'Sandstorm' on it. Jaakko signed Darude up to 16 Inch Records. The single 'Sandstorm' was the first release on the label and jumped directly to Nr.1 in the dance chart and staying in the charts for 16 weeks. 'Sandstorm' has now sold platinum in many countries and was just RIAA certified 'Gold' for 500.000 downloads in USA.

In 2004 in addition to his live performances, Darude started focusing on touring as a DJ. As a DJ his style is a mix of progressive & uplifting trance, but he also plays tech, breaks and house tracks with even the occasional heavy metal samples, which mirrors his production style as well.

                                        David Ryan Harris is a singer-songwriter based in Los Angeles, California. Born in Evanston, Illinois, Harris moved to Atlanta at a young age. Harris has had a varied career as a musician. He is married and has four sons: Miles, Life, River, and Truman.

Career


Follow for Now

Harris has been performing on stage since the 1980s when he served as frontman for the Atlanta rock group Follow for Now. Harris' eclectic taste in music is apparent in the band's music, which shows influences ranging from Motown to thrash metal. Follow for Now was given a record deal through Chrysalis Records and after working with producer Brendan O'Brien, released an unsuccessful self-titled album. The band members parted ways in 1994.


Solo career

After a short period out of the limelight, Harris began working as a producer and featured guitarist with Dionne Farris, a former vocalist from hip-hop group Arrested Development. Harris‚Äô guitar work can be heard throughout Farris‚Äô 1995 album Wild Seed, Wild Flower.

Harris worked with Farris until he launched his solo career in 1997. He reunited with Brendan O'Brien and was signed to Columbia Records, where the two would produce Harris‚Äô solo debut. While the album was praised by critics, Harris‚Äô range of musical influences made the album difficult to sell and he soon moved on to his next project.

After the breakup with The Brand New Immortals in 2002, he continued going solo. He released two more albums : Soulstice (2003) and The Bittersweet (2006)

Brand New Immortals

Still working with O‚ÄôBrien, Harris united with drummer Kenny Creswell and former bassist of the Black Crowes Johnny Colt, Harris created the trio Brand New Immortals. The group released a successful 6 track EP and were signed to Elektra Records. In 2001, the trio produced a full length album entitled Tragic Show,[2] which the band felt that Elektra did not properly promote. Early the next year the band broke up and Harris returned to the pursuit of success as a solo artist.


Recent Work

In 2009 he co-wrote four tracks with Sebastian for his fifth album, including the title track ""Like it Like That"". Harris also played on and produced this single which reached number one and triple platinum in Australia and was the highest selling Australian artist song of 2009.[6][7] Harris co-produced the album and contributed backing vocals and played instruments on some of the tracks. The album was released in the US in 2010.[8] In 2012 Harris co-wrote ""Battle Scars"" with Sebastian. The song which has a rap written and performed by Lupe Fiasco reached number one and 9x platinum in Australia.[9][10] It also reached number two and double platinum in New Zealand, and number two in Norway.[11][12][13] ""Battle Scars"" spent 20 weeks on the US Billboard Hot 100 Chart peaking at number 71, and was certified platinum for 1 million sales.[14][15] Ryan Harris toured Australia with Sebastian on the 46 date Get Along Tour in 2013.

Harris has also played guitar on the album, Who I Am from Nick Jonas And The Administration which was released on February 2, 2010, but former New Power Generation bassist Sonny Thompson will replace him for live shows. In late 2011, Harris produced Australian singer-songwriter Amali Ward's debut album ""Back in Time"" due for release in 2013.

death-angel,"
                                        Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) band from San Francisco, CA.

Death Angel was formed in 1982 by cousins, guitarists Rob Cavestany and Gus Pepa, bassist Dennis Pepa and drummer Andy Galeon. Mark Osegueda, who is second cousin to the founding members and was their roadie, joined as the vocalist in 1984.

Death Angel were a mainstay of the Bay Area thrash movement in the early 80s and recorded their demo, Kill As One, produced by Metallica's Kirk Hammett. The success of the demo which was credited to the underground tape-trading scene, led to a record deal with Enigma Records. Their debut album, The Ultra-Violence, was released in 1987. The follow up, Frolic Through The Park, was released in 1988, which spawned the single ""Bored"" and was later featured in Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. 

Geffen bought Death Angel out of their record deal with Enigma in 1989. In turn, Enigma released an unauthorized Death Angel live album, Fall From Grace, without their knowledge. Their third studio album, Act III was released in 1990. The album features the singles ""Seemingly Endless Time"" and ""A Room with a View"", and received heavy rotation on MTV's Headbanger's Ball. 

The group's tour bus crashed in Arizona en route to a show in Las Vegas, Nevada. Drummer Andy Galeon was critically injured and required more than a year to recover. At the urging by Geffen to continue the tour without Galeon, the band refused and were eventually dropped. Osegueda said he quit the band two days after accident and moved to New York. The band eventually parted ways.

In the time of their breakup, the members were involved in various music projects. At the request of Chuck Billy of Testament, they reunited for a one-off gig for the Clash of the Titans benefit concert. However, with Gus Pepa was living in the Philippines at the time, Ted Aguilar was brought on as his replacement.  Due to the positive reception, they played various gigs throughout the San Francisco area. In October 2003, they were signed to Nuclear Blast, and released their first album in 14 years, The Art of Dying, in 2004.

Invited by Dave Grohl to record at his studio, they recorded and released Killing Season in 2008, their fifth studio album and the final studio album featuring the original line up. In October 2008, it was announced that Dennis Pepa was leaving the band. The following year, Andy Galeon was forced to leave the band due to his commitments as a new father.

Their sixth studio album, Relentless Retribution, was released in 2010. It was produced by Jason Suecof and Rob Cavestany and marked a return to their trash metal sound. Now featuring Damien Sisson on bass and Will Carroll on drums, the line up also released The Dream Calls for Blood in 2013. Cavestany stated that he saw The Dream Calls for Blood as a companion piece to Relentless Retribution and once again, produced the album with Jason Suecof. It has been their most well-received album since Act III, landing at number 72 on the Billboard 200 and selling 5,400 copies in the US in its first week of release.

Raised in Carol City, Florida, Curry started rapping while in sixth grade and began working on his first mixtape in 2011, when he was attending school. Influenced by underground Florida rapper SpaceGhostPurrp, the mixtape was later featured on Purrp's social media, giving Curry local attention and resulting in Curry joining Purrp's hip-hop collective, Raider Klan.

Curry left Raider Klan in 2013, releasing his debut full-length album a year later while still in high school, titled Nostalgic 64 on September 3, 2013. He has gone on to release two more projects, Imperial on March 9, 2016, and Ta13oo on July 27, 2018, which debuted at number 28 on the Billboard 200 chart.

                                        English electronic music band formed March 1980 in Basildon, Essex, and named after a popular French fashion magazine. The group's original line-up consisted of Dave Gahan (lead vocals, occasional songwriter since 2005), Martin L. Gore (keyboards, guitar, vocals, chief songwriter after 1981), Andy Fletcher (keyboards) and Vince Clarke (keyboards, chief songwriter from 1980 until 1981). Depeche Mode released their debut record in 1981, Speak & Spell, bringing the band onto the British new wave scene. Clarke left the band after the release of the album, leaving the band as a trio to record A Broken Frame, released the following year. Gore took over lead songwriting duties and, later in 1982, Alan Wilder (keyboards, drums, occasional songwriter) officially joined the band to fill Clarke's spot, establishing a line up that would continue for the next thirteen years.

The band's last albums of the 1980s, Black Celebration and Music for the Masses, established them as a dominant force on the mainstream electronic music scene. A highlight of this era was the band's concert at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, where they drew a crowd in excess of 60,000 people. In the new decade, Depeche Mode released Violator, a mainstream success. The subsequent album, Songs Of Faith And Devotion, and the supporting Devotional Tour exacerbated tensions within the band to the point where Alan Wilder quit in 1995, leading to intense media and fan speculation that the band would split. Now a trio once again, the band released Ultra in 1997, recorded at the height of Gahan's near-fatal drug abuse, Gore's alcoholism and seizures and Fletcher's depression. The release of Exciter confirmed Depeche Mode's willingness to remain together, the subsequent, and very successful, Exciter Tour being their first tour in support of an original album in eight years since the Devotional Tour, although the band had toured in 1998 to support The Singles 86‚Äì98 compilation album.

Depeche Mode have had fifty songs in the UK Singles Chart and thirteen top 10 albums in the UK charts, two of which debuted at No. 1. Depeche Mode have to this day sold over 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the most commercially successful electronic bands and one of the world's best-selling music artists in the world. Q magazine calls Depeche Mode ""the most popular electronic band the world has ever known"" and included the band in the list of the ""50 Bands That Changed the World!"". Depeche Mode also rank number 98 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists Of All Time.

Derek Webb was an integral member of Caedmon's Call until he left the band in February 2003 to pursue a solo career. He was one of the group's principal songwriters and lead vocalists (this duty being shared between Webb, Cliff Young and Danielle Young). Derek was introduced to Caedmon's Call via Aaron Tate (another of the band's principal songwriters). After Aaron decided he wasn't going to tour as a performing member of the band, Derek filled his spot. In fact, Derek didn't even meet all of the band members until after they played their first show together. 

His solo career has been somewhat controversial, particularly in more conservative Christian circles, for his use of 'strong' language on his first album She Must & Shall Go Free. At the request of two major Christian music retailers, the offensive words were removed from the final version of the album, but other retailers still refused to stock the album at all. He has since released a number of albums in quick succession, all still featuring so-called 'controversial' lyrics, and all pursuing slightly different musical approaches than the album preceding it. Fortunately though, Derek Webb continues to be a firm favourite amongst the majority of Christian audiences, and is now a member of the Square Peg Alliance, a collective of independent Christian musicians who share similar views on their music and ministry and have come together in order to promote and support each other's music.

                                        Destrage is an Italian progressive metalcore band, formed in 2002. They have released five studio albums and are currently signed to Metal Blade Records.

destruction,"
                                        German Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) band from Weil am Rhein. 

Destruction was formed in 1983 by Marcel Schirmer alias Schmier (bass, vocals), Mike Sifringer (guitar) and Tommy Sandmann (drums). 

They made a rather raw debut with 1984's mini-album Sentence Of Death, but quickly refined their sound into potent, powerful thrash for the excellent Infernal Overkill. 

Second guitarist Harry Wilkens joined following the recording of the equally ferocious Eternal Devastation to bolster the live sound, although Sandmann also departed to be replaced by Oliver Kaiser, and the pair made their debut on the Mad Butcher EP. 

Release From Agony saw the band make full use of the extra dimension the second guitar added, although their increasing musical dexterity and more intricate song structures did nothing to temper Destruction's aggression and heaviness, and the band began to extend themselves abroad, playing with Mot√∂rhead across Europe and on a few dates of Slayer's US tour. 

Live Without Sense was an adequate display of the band's onstage power, but Destruction's fortunes took a downturn after they supported Celtic Frost on their Cold Lake UK tour. Internal dissent led to Schmier's departure, with the rest of the band electing to pursue a more melodic direction. 

Cracked Brain was recorded with new bassist Christian Engler and stand-in vocalist Andre Grieder, but was disappointing. Further credibility was lost with a pointless cover version of the Knack's ""My Sharona', and Destruction soon folded. 

The band re-formed in the mid-90s with new members Thomas Rosenmerkel (vocals) and Michael Piranio (guitars) to record the Destruction and Them Not Me EPs, and 1996""s The Least Successful Human Cannonball, all of which were released on their own Brain Butcher label. Sifringer and Schmier inaugurated a full-scale reformation in 1999, recruiting new drummer Sven Herwig to record All Hell Breaks Loose. 

Additional notes: 
Arguably the first German thrash band. Their original name was Knight of Demon, but that was changed after a few weeks. They went from an Iron Maiden-esque sound to one heavily influenced by Venom in a matter of weeks. 

In the early 90's Flemming Ronsdorf (Artillery) was asked to join Destruction as new vocalist. He rehearsed with the band, but didn't join because the label didn't want to send him money in advance before the upcoming tour (according to Ronsdorf). 

The releases between 1994 and 1998 have been disowned by the band and are now classed as ""Neo-Destruction"" and not part of their offical discography. 

Schmier performed guest vocals on the 2006 album ""The Winter Wake"" by the Folk Metal band Elvenking.

                                        Born on May 5th 1972 in Vancouver, Canada, Devin Townsend is a multi-instrumentalist and producer. At the age of 19, he caught the attention of Steve Vai, who recruited him as the vocalist in his band, Vai, for the ""Sex & Religion"" album and consequent world tour. Since then, he spent his career in projects he started himself, as an expression of the different ""sides"" of his creativity: the two main projects are Strapping Young Lad (a speed/industrial metal band), and the Devin Townsend Band (formerly known as Ocean Machine).

Devin's current project, known as Devin Townsend Project, is a musical journey through the past 3 years of his life, having a kid, quitting marijuana and booze, and many other personal changes.  The Project consists of 4 albums which will be released 2009-2010. The chronological order of the albums is ""Ki"", ""Addicted"", ""Deconstruction"" and ""Ghost"".

                                        New-wave group popular throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, formed by a group of art students at Kent State University, principally Mark Mothersbaugh and Jerry Casale. Their name comes from the central concept of ""de-evolution"" - the idea that mankind is devolving instead of evolving, as evidenced by the encroaching gullibility and herd mentality of the American people. 

After releasing several records on their own Booji Boy label, their work on the short film The Truth About De-Evolution in 1976 got them signed to Warner Brothers, where they had a major hit in 1980 with the single ""Whip It"". After 1980, their career continuously faded from the public eye until the band called it quits in the early 1990s. However, they reformed for a series of live dates in 2004.

They are also perhaps best known as one of the main influences on Metallica (and to some extent Megadeth). 

Long-time vocalist Sean Harris joined shortly after the band's formation. The band released their first album in 1980 after a series of singles and independent demos, and continued releasing material and touring until their first breakup in 1985.

The band reformed again in 1991, and released the Death & Progress album. However, the band was close to breaking up just after the record's release and eventually did in 1994, not reforming again until 2000. They released the Acoustic Cuts EP but again broke up (due to Harris' problems with the rest of the band) in 2004. 

In 2004 the band brought in replacement singer Nick Tart, and recorded their first full album in years entitled All Will Be Revealed, released in 2005. They toured with Megadeth throughout the year, also appearing at an anniversary concert for the NWOBHM scene at the London Astoria. In 2006 they also released both a live album and their first DVD, and started writing their 2nd album with Nick Tart. What's In Your Head? was released in 2007 and the band supported the album on tour with Thin Lizzy across Europe.

dio,"
                                        Dio was a heavy metal band formed by singer Ronnie James Dio and drummer Vinny Appice in 1982 following their depature from Black Sabbath.  Although Ronnie claimed that his intention was to form a band and not a solo project, he remained the only continuous member and the prime creative force in the band throughout its lifespan.

The original line-up was rounded out by bassist Jimmy Bain and guitarist Vivian Campbell for the band's debut, 1983's ""Holy Diver"".  The album remains the group's most well-known and commercially successful release.  The band added keyboardist Claude Schnell afterwards and this line-up appeared on the band's next two LPs, ""Last In Line"" (1984) and ""Sacred Heart"" (1985), both of which were commercial successes.  Vivian Campbell left the band in 1986 and was replaced by Craig Goldy for 1987's ""Dream Evil"".  However, by the time Dio released their next album, 1990's ""Lock Up The Wolves"", the group's popularity was waning and the band had undergone a complete overhaul, with only Ronnie remaining from the original line-up.

By the start of the 1990s, both Dio and Ronnie's former band, Black Sabbath, saw that their separate commercial fortunes were waning.  In an attempt to rekindle their old magic, Ronnie put Dio to rest and joined forces with Vinny Appice, Geezer Butler, and Tony Iommi for the 1992 Black Sabbath record, ""Dehumanizer"".  The release met with a largely positive reception from most fans but old personal issues were still unresolved and Ronnie and Vinny departed Black Sabbath again in 1993 and launched a new version of Dio.  The new band included guitarist Tracy G, bassist Jeff Pilson, and keyboardist Scott Warren.  This line-up recorded 1994's ""Strange Highways"" (Dio's last album for a major label) and 1996's ""Angry Machines"".  These albums saw the band turn away from the ""sword & sorcery"" lyrics and traditional heavy metal sound of the old days and move towards more modern sounds and lyrical issues. Many fans were not receptive towards these changes.

2000's ""Magica"" not only saw Dio return to the ""classic"" sound of the band, but also saw the return of Jimmy Bain, Craig Goldy, and drummer Simon Wright (the latter of whom had played on ""Lock Up The Wolves"").  The follow-up to ""Magica"", 2002's ""Killing The Dragon"" saw Goldy replaced by Doug Aldrich.  In 2004, Goldy would return to replace Aldrich and Jimmy Bain quit the band again.  Jeff Pilson would return for bass duties on 2004's ""Master Of The Moon"", although other obligations prevented him from touring so Rudy Sarzo joined as the band's live bass player.  Doug Aldrich replaced Goldy again in 2005 and appeared on two live releases, ""Evil Or Divine - Live In New York City"" and ""Holy Diver - Live"", before Goldy would once again rejoin the band in 2006.

In 2007, the Dio band went on hiatus again as Ronnie re-teamed with Geezer Butler, Tony Iommi, and Vinny Appice to form Heaven & Hell. Although, Ronnie stated that the Dio band would continue, with plans for making ""Magica II"" and ""Magica III"", this would not come to pass, as in late 2009, the singer was diagnosed with stomach cancer.  He passed away in May 2010.

                                        Thomas Wesley Pentz, better known as Diplo, is unquestionably one of the most dynamic forces in music today. He is as much as an international brand (tastemaker, spokesman, curator) as he is a musician/DJ/producer. Year after year, he‚Äôs proven himself to be an ubiquitous cultural figure, consistently bridging high and low, mainstream and underground, with remarkable tact and reverence.
              
In 2004, after studying film at Temple University, throwing influential parties in South Philadelphia, and releasing multiple mixtapes promoting the aesthetic of his party, Hollertronix, Pentz cemented himself as a full fledged artist through his debut album, ‚ÄúFlorida.‚Äù Receiving praise within the underground community, ‚ÄúFlorida‚Äù caught the attention of XL Recording‚Äôs newest act at the time - M.I.A. - who partnered with Pentz to release mixtape  ‚ÄúPiracy Funds Terrorism Vol. 1.‚Äù This pivotal mixtape (listed by the New York Times and Pitchfork Media as ‚ÄúAlbum of the Year‚Äù) helped build buzz for M.I.A.‚Äôs debut and boosted Diplo‚Äôs reputation as a scene-spotter, championing the mongrel pop of the global underclass to the speakers of American clubs. Diplo would continue to work with M.I.A. on her first and second albums, eventually creating the Grammy nominated track ‚ÄúPaper Planes‚Äù in 2007, which hit No. 4 in the U.S. Hot 100 Charts and has sold more than 3 million copies.

In 2005, Diplo founded label/culture lab Mad Decent to serve as a showcasing platform for the myriad of fascinating sounds Pentz encounters while touring the world. The early release of Brazilian group Bonde do Role remains a testament to Diplo‚Äôs aspirations, as their music helped define Baile Funk in the United States. Mad Decent has gone on to release music from a dynamic range of artists that include Santigold, Peter Bjorn And John, Rusko, Crookers, Bosco Delrey, Lil‚Äô Jon, Gucci Mane, Buraka Som Sistema, Dillon Francis, Riff Raff, Baauer and Major Lazer. Coming full circle from his days of Hollertronix, Diplo has also utilized the label to produce the annual and infamous Mad Decent block parties ‚Äì a series of outdoor dance parties/concerts that now span 19 cities across North America.
           
After multiple Grammy nominations, including Producer of the Year, and being crowned the #1 most streamed artist on Soundcloud in 2013, Diplo‚Äôs might continues to grow in 2014. Diplo‚Äôs touring remains extensive, playing hard ticket venues all around the world 300 days of the year, headlining the 22-city Mad Decent Block Party tour across North America, as well as launching the inaugural Mad Decent Boat Party on the Caribbean seas.  Following the success of Diplo‚Äôs ‚ÄúExpress Yourself‚Äù EP in 2012 and Major Lazer‚Äôs sophomore album Free The Universe in 2013, 2014 will see the release of his compilation album Random White Dude Be Everywhere, which includes some of his biggest recent hits that have been seen in TV commercials for Doritos and Fiat. His chart-climbing single ‚ÄúRevolution‚Äù recently broke the Top 40 Pop Chart at radio, making it Diplo‚Äôs biggest hit to date. In addition, Beyonce‚Äôs ‚ÄúRun The World‚Äù heavily sampled Major Lazer‚Äôs ‚ÄúPon De Floor‚Äù and went on to sell over a million copies, further cementing Diplo‚Äôs place in the pop world. He remains the go-to producer for the who‚Äôs who of the pop music landscape ‚Äì Usher, Snoop Dogg, Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne, No Doubt, Beyonc√©, Madonna, Pharrell Williams and more.

‚ÄúLean On‚Äù the global smash hit from Major Lazer‚Äôs June 2015 release Peace Is the Mission has garnered a host of accolades including reaching #1 at Top 40 Radio, a first for any independent label, being named Spotify‚Äôs Global Song of the Summer as well as the 4th most streamed track in history making it the most successful independent song of all time.
             
Diplo is truly a jack of all trades - he‚Äôs contributed to Vanity Fair, yields regular radio shows on BBC Radio 1 and Clear Channel Media stations, as well as his new show Lazer Sound on Apple Music‚Äôs Beats1, has modeled for the campaign of fashion designer Alexander Wang, released the coffee table book 128 Beats Per Minute and the documentary film, Favela On Blast, made a cameo in 22 Jump Street and starred as the host of the ?uestlove-produced VH1 show, SoundClash. Diplo is a dynamic and self-driven spirit with interests that span far beyond any singular culture or musical realm; he is truly the 21st century artist.

                                        Paul Harris, Steve Smith and Ben Harris are three lads from Kent and the South London suburbs with very different musical backgrounds, united by a shared love of a good tune and a passion for partying.

Paul Harris started clubbing in his early teens and blagged his first professional DJ gig when he was 17, just before acid house took dance culture mainstream. He gradually began spending more time mixing and making records than playing them, but has continued to be successful as a DJ.

A drummer since schooldays, Steve Smith gave up his job in the print trade during the rave explosion when he realised he could make more money playing live percussion in clubs at weekends. By the mid-90s he was playing in a band called Higher Ground, and when the singer left he reluctantly stepped in, discovering with some surprise that he had a fine voice. When the band fell apart he went to Ibiza to write, but then a chance meeting with Paul at an airport on the way to a club event led to a wild weekend, and the idea of making music together.

Ben Harris (no relation to Paul) played guitar in indie rock band Fluid until they did their first demo and he saw how the engineer worked the mixing desk. He got a job in a recording studio, ""got bitten by the dance bug"", and ended up running a specialist dance record shop in Bromley with his brother. After producing a string of successful one-off club tunes he began working with Paul, who a few weeks later bumped into Steve and invited him to join them.

Two demos were made, ""Dismembered"" in 1988 and ""Last Blasphemies"" in 1989. The band then split up and Blomqvist and Estby joined Carnage but it ended when Michael Amott left for Carcass. The remaining Carnage members Estby, Matti K√§rki (vocals) and Blomqvist decided to reform Dismember. 

In 1991 a demo, ""Reborn in Blasphemy"", was recorded. Senneb√§ck returned to the band and Richard Cabeza (bass) of Carbonized also joined the band. They were then signed to Nuclear Blast and soon they recorded ""Like an Ever Flowing Stream"" and released it same year. In June 1991 they went on their first European tour with Morbid Angel and in March 1992 they released a 5-track EP called ""Pieces"". Shortly after the release they went on another tour with Napalm Death and Obituary. 

In 1993 ""Indecent and Obscene"" was released and it was followed by a US tour and then a European one. The two EPs ""Casket Garden"" and ""Misanthropic"" were released in 1995 and were followed by the succes album, ""Massive Killing Capacity"". Then ""Death Metal"" was released in 1997 and after the release Magnus Sahlgren (guitar) replaced Senneb√§ck. Cabeza left the band before the recording of ""Hate Campaign"" which featured Sharlee D'Angelo (bass) of Mercyful Fate. The album was released in 2000 and shortly after Sharlee D'Angelo had to leave for the returning Richard Cabeza. 

""Where Ironcrosses Grow"" was then released in 2004.

dissection,"
                                        Black/Death metal band from Str√∂mstad, Sweden, formed in 1989. Later relocated to Stockholm.

Jon N√∂dtveidt (guitars, vocals) and Peter Palmdahl (bass) used to play in a Thrash metal band Siren's Yell, but when the group disbanded in 1989, the two members joined forces with Ole √ñhman and formed Dissection. Band's recording career started with the demos ""The Grief Prophecy"" and ""Into Infinite Obscurity"", which were both released in 1991. By the second demo guitarist John Zwetsloot had also joined the groups. Their first full length, ""The Somberlain"", was released in 1993 by No Fashion Records. The album allowed the band gain popularity in the underground and above, also thanks to the connection between the members and the infamous black metal band Mayhem (the album was dedicated to Euronymous). 

John Zwetsloot was eventually kicked out due to lazyness in 1994 and was replaced by Johan Norman and the band recorded their second full length album titled ""Storm Of The Light's Bane"", which was released on Nuclear Blast and is considered one of the best albums in the genre. Ole √ñhman got kicked out of the band soon after the release and the band was replaced by Tobias Kjellgren and the band toured the world. In 1997 all of the members, except Jon, either quit the band or was kicked out and Jon started to put together a new line-up. Following that mishappening, Jon N√∂dtveidt was arrested for killing a 37-year old homosexual and Dissection was no more....or, at least, that's what they made their fans believe for a while. 

""The Past Is Alive"" was released following the arrest as a collection of older recordings. ""Storm Of The Light's Bane"" and ""Where Dead Angels Lie"" were re-released into one big album in 2002 with ""Storm Of The Light's Bane/Where Dead Angels Lie"". 

The band officialy declared their comeback in 2003. ""Live Legacy"", a 1997 live recording at the Wacken Open Air festival was released in the same period.

On the 30th of October 2004 Dissection made its triumphant return with their first show in seven year at Arenan in Stockholm. The show was witnessed by 3000 fans and was filmed for a DVD which was released in the summer of 2006. In November 2004 they released the single ""Maha Kali"". During the end of 2004 and mid 2005 the band did extensive touring and started the recording of their third full-length album ""Reinkaos"" wich was released on the 30th of April 2006 on their own label Black Horizon Music. They also re-released their two previous albums with extensive bonus material, that consisted of rare and unreleased recordings, in June 2006. 

On the 24th of June 2006 the band made it's last show ever at Hovet, Stockholm. The show was filmed and recorded for a upcoming DVD and CD release. 

Jon N√∂dtveidt commited suicide sometime between the 14th and 16th of August 2006.

They became known for their lively group personae, instrumental virtuosity, fashion sense, and outspoken views. In particular, Natalie Maines' public criticism of President George W. Bush on the eve of the 2003 invasion of Iraq led to considerable controversy for the group, causing them to lose a large part of their core country audience, but gain a new if somewhat smaller audience in the process.

doe-maar,"
                                        Dutch pop/ska/reggae band.

Doe Maar formed in 1978 by Ernst Jansz and Piet Dekker. The band was active till April 1984.
It had short reunions in 1999-2000 (incl. a new album and 16 sold-out shows at the Ahoy' Rotterdam), 2008, and 2011-2013 (incl. album).

In the first half of the eighties up to the disbanding in 1984, Doe Maar's music and the looks of especially Vrienten and Jansz caused a popularity among young girls in particular, that could only be described as Beatlesque. The disruption this caused to the private lives of the band members was the primary reason to split up in 1984.

                                        Domenico Modugno (January 9, 1928 ‚Äì August 6, 1994) was an Italian singer and songwriter.
Modugno was born in Polignano a Mare, province of Bari (Apulia). From a young age he wanted to become an actor and in 1951, after his military service, he enrolled in an acting school. While still studying he had a role in a cinematographic version of Filumena Marturano by Eduardo De Filippo as well as some other films. In 1957, his song ""Lazzarella"", sung by Aurelio Fierro, came second in the Festival della Canzone Napoletana, bringing him his first taste of popularity. In 1958 Modugno took part in Antonio Aniante's comedy La Rosa di Zolfo at the Festival della Prosa in Venice. The turning point of his career came in that year, when he also participated in the Sanremo Music Festival, presenting, together with Johnny Dorelli, the song ""Nel blu dipinto di blu"". Co-authored by him and Franco Migliacci, the song won the contest and suddenly became an enormous discographical success worldwide, especially in the United States. It received two Grammy Awards with sales far over a million copies, and represented Italy in the 1958 Eurovision Song Contest, where it came in third. In 1959, Modugno won the Sanremo Music Festival for the second time in a row, with ""Piove"" (also known as ""Ciao, ciao bambina""), and received second place in 1960 with ""Libero"". This was a successful period of time for Modugno who again represented Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest of 1959. Later his hit song ""Io"" was sung by Elvis Presley in English with the title ""Ask Me"". In 1962, Modugno won the Sanremo Music Festival a third time with ""Addio..., addio..."". Four years later, he again represents Italy at Eurovision with ""Dio, come ti amo"". The 1970s kept Modugno's voice and mind busy in more classic music genres and profiles, as a singer and as a musician, adapting poetry, acting on television and in lead singing roles of modern operas. In 1986, Modugno entered the political arena as a member of the Italian Radical Party and was elected congressman for Turin in June 1987. In this last stage of his life, he was very active in social issues, fighting against inhuman conditions of patients in the Agrigento psychiatric hospital. Domenico Modugno died from a heart attack in Lampedusa, Italy, in August 1994 in his home by the sea.

                                        Don Williams (born May 27, 1939, Floydada, Texas, United States), is an American country singer, songwriter and a 2010 inductee to the Country Music Hall of Fame. He grew up in Portland, Texas, and graduated in 1958 from Gregory-Portland High School. After seven years with the folk-pop group Pozo-Seco Singers, he began his solo career in 1971, singing popular ballads and amassing 17 No. 1 Country & Western hits.

When Don was three years old he sang in a local talent contest‚Äîhis first public performance‚Äîand won first prize, an alarm clock. He began playing guitar as a teenager, which he learned from his mother. While a teenager, he played with country, rock n' roll and folk bands. He formed his first band with Lofton Kline, called The Strangers Two, and in 1964 was approached by Susan Taylor to form a trio which ultimately became the Pozo-Seco Singers, a folk-pop group. The band recorded a song called, ""Time"" on a local label called Edmark Records and it became a regional hit in their home state of Texas. Columbia Records, picked up the record, signed the group, and released a series of Top 50 hits and three albums.
Lofton Kline left the trio, so Don and Susan renamed the Duo ""Pozo Seco"". After two more albums they both disbanded in 1971, at which point Williams embarked on a solo career.

Williams started out as a songwriter for Jack Music Inc. Eventually, he signed with JMI Records as a solo artist. His 1974 song, ""We Should Be Together,"" reached number five, and he signed with ABC/Dot Records. His first single with ABC/Dot, ""I Wouldn't Want to Live If You Didn't Love Me,"" became a number one hit, and was the first of a string of top ten hits he had between 1974 and 1991. Only four of his 46 singles didn't make it to the Top Ten.

Early in 2006, Williams announced his ""Farewell Tour of the World"" and played numerous dates both in the U.S. and abroad, wrapping the tour up with the ""Final Farewell Concert"" in Memphis, Tennessee at the Cannon Center for Performing Arts on November 21, 2006. Playing to a full house, the final event was well received and quite emotional for fans in attendance.

As of 2010, Williams had come out of retirement and was once again touring.

In March 2012, Williams announced the release of a new record And So It Goes (UK release April 30, 2012; US/Worldwide release June 19, 2012), his first new record since 2004. The record is his first with the independent Americana label Sugar Hill Records. The record includes guest appearances by Alison Krauss, Keith Urban, and Vince Gill.

To accompany his latest album release he embarked on a UK Tour.

His straightforward yet smooth bass-baritone voice, soft tones, and an imposing build earned him the nickname ""The Gentle Giant"" of country music.

dope,"
                                        The band was founded by song writer and lead singer Edsel Dope in 1997. As a child, Edsel and his brother, Simon Dope, were separated when their parents divorced. When the two were adults, they reunited and Simon joined Edsel's band, playing keyboards. The pair then recruited Tripp Eisen as guitarist, Preston Nash as drummer, and Acey Slade as bassist.

Unlike many of the popular bands from the 1990s, Dope derived their sound from influences taken from hard rock bands and fused that with the sound of industrial rock acts which had made waves earlier in the decade, such as Ministry, as well as industrial music act Skinny Puppy.

In their earliest days, the band sold drugs to survive and purchase instruments. Furthermore, the name ""Dope"" refers to drugs and drug culture, as shown by their early T-shirt designs, which prominently displayed hypodermic needles.

dotan,"
                                        Dutch singer-songwriter/multi instrumentalist/producer, born in Jerusalem and grew up in Amsterdam.
Dotan‚Äôs musical career got off to a flying start in 2011. He had brazenly sent an e-mail containing some of his own compositions to record producers Sacha Skarbek and Martin Terefe (of James Morrison, Paul McCartney, Jason Miraz and Adele fame) and had been invited to their London studio. Dutch top DJ Giel Beelen had nominated Dotan as the most promising new talent of 2011 and singles from Dotan‚Äôs debut album Dream Parade received heavy airplay on Dutch radio stations. Dotan also opened shows for, amongst others, Gavin DeGraw and Sinead O‚ÄôConnor and together with his band embarked on a massive tour of all the major clubs in the Netherlands. But the immediate success did not sit easy with him. He was constantly overtaken by the speed of events. ‚ÄúI felt a lot of pressure. But I put that on myself and simply couldn‚Äôt deal with it.‚Äù Slowly, the fun of making music faded and he felt it was time for a drastic change.
On January 31, 2014 Dotan released his second studio album, 7 Layers in Paradiso (Amsterdam). 
The album quickly reached number 2 on the Dutch Top 100 Charts according to Dutch news website NU.nl. Home reached the first position in the Netherlands.

                                        Born : November 21, 1940 // New Orleans, Louisiana, USA
 
Rebennack began playing the piano at the age of six and, as he grew up, he became strongly influenced by the style of Roy Byrd (aka Professor Longhair). He immersed himself in the music and voodoo cultures of New Orleans, where he became known as Mac Rebennack, playing the organ in strip-clubs with 'make-up' bands in the French Quarter.

However, it was as a session guitarist with John Vincent's Ace Records that gave him his first break, around1957. He worked with the New Orleans R&B session crew at Crescent City's 'Cosimo V. Matassa' studio and with an 'All For One' co-operative formed by Harold Battiste- cutting ""Storm Warning"" (Rex, 1957) and albums on Ace, Rex and AFO (an acronym of All For One) .

Rebennack then moved to California in 1962 with Battiste's crew, where they played on Sam Cooke's final recording session. Rebennack subsequently undertook a lot of session work around LA (appearing briefly for a ""Freak Out!"" album session with Zappa) and developed his 'Mardi Gras' persona of ""Dr. John Creaux, The Night Tripper"" with Battiste's help, assembling the ""Gris-Gris"" album whilst sessioning for Sonny & Cher.

His drawled and ponderous style, tinged with a husky Southern Comfort delivery, caught the mood of the moment upon the album's release in 1968 giving him the commercial freedom to explore the many facets of the Louisiana blues and Memphis funk cultures in following releases. His recordings have been supported by such alumni as Clapton, Jagger, Allen Toussaint, The Meters, Jerry Wexler and Mike Bloomfield. He had a top-ten hit with ""Right Place, Wrong Time"", he appeared in the Martin Scorsese film The Last Waltz (1978) and has regularly released material to date.

dropkick-murphys,"
                                        Oi! Punk band from Boston, MA, formed in 1996 by Ken Casey (bass/vocals), Rick Barton (guitar) and Mike McColgan (vocals).  The band is known for its Oi!/punk sound, its frequent covers of Irish standards, and lyrics which often focus on unions and working class ethics and concerns.  In 1998, the band signed to Hellcat Records, a label run by members of Rancid and connected to Epitaph Records.  After the release of their first LP, ""Do Or Die"", Mike McColgan left the band to pursue his desire to become a firefighter.  The split was amicable and McColgan would return to music a few years later, fronting the Street Dogs.  He was replaced by Al Barr.  Rick Barton left after the band's second album, ""The Gang's All Here"" to pursue outside interests.  By the release of their next album, ""Sing Loud, Sing Proud"", the band had expanded to include Casey, Barr, longtime drummer Matt Kelly, 2 guitarists, a mandolin player, and a bagpipe player.

In 2004, the Dropkick Murphys recorded and released the song ""Tessie"", an old tune associated with the Boston Red Sox baseball team.  The song was featured in the movie ""Fever Pitch"".  In 2006, the band recorded ""I'm Shipping Up To Boston"", which used lyrics from an old Woody Guthrie poem and was featured in the movie ""The Departed"".  It remains perhaps their best-known song.

In 2007, the Dropkick Murphys formed their own record label, Born & Bred Records, to release their material.

""Art is dangerous. It is one of the attractions: when it ceases to be dangerous you don't want it."" Duke Ellington. 

Ellington was an outstanding composer. He wrote thousands of works, composing popular songs, art songs, a wide variety of instrumentals, suites, symphonic works, movie and TV scores, and music for ballet ‚Äì all of a very high quality. 

But to say merely that Ellington was a great composer ignores his achievement as a musician. Ellington is probably the only musician whose name has been associated with a particular style ""Ellingtonia"". This style does not imply a specific tempo or specific mood, but also a certain standard of quality. Whoever plays ""Ellingtonia"" must adhere to these standards. Many significant bands have attempted to copy his style. 

For Jazz, Ellington was the first orchestra leader to substitute voices for instruments, he popularized the Baritone Sax when he engaged Harry Carney, he influenced countless bands and dance orchestras. 

Beginning with his ""Jungle Band"" to his ""Famous Orchestra"" which appeared at Carnegie Hall numerous times and even introduced several Jazz suite that Duke had composed, Ellington his the most successful and important orchestra leader in Jazz history. Success did not come easily taking him many years of devoted work to make a name for himself. 

He began as a Ragtime pianist in his hometown of Washington. His first composition was ""Soda Fountain Rag"" which he never recorded. In 1922 he led a fairly successful band which featured Sonny Greer and Otto Hardwick. Several years later, when he opened at the New York Kentuky Club he succeeded in capture the public fancy. This was the first band to capture the now legendary Ellington sound which is clearly present in the number ""The Creeper"", recorded at the end of 1926. 

On 12 April 1927, Duke & his orchestra began the engagement which was to make him world famous: Irvin Mills brought them to the Cotton Club, where they stayed five years. There he laid the Jungle, the Mood and other styles. From December 1926 to October 1930 the Ellington band spent at least 64 days in the studios of 14 recording companies, using 18 different pseudonyms for his band, they recorded about 170 titles. 

He is also the father of Mercer Ellington.

                                        Since John Gallagher and Jason Netherton first formed the band during 'the popular days of Death Metal' in 1991, Dying Fetus have progressed, gained it's unique style and become one of the most acclaimed and popular Death Metal/Grindcore acts in the metal underground. 

The band's members combine technical brutality with catchy song structures which make each single track they have released so far innovative and memorable. 

After touring with bands such as The Berzerker, Hate Eternal, Gorguts, Skinless and other modern Death Metal acts and releasing five full-lenghts; Jason left the band while Sparky Voyles and Kevin Talley were asked to leave because of various internal conflicts. 

Everyone was obviously expecting Dying Fetus' imminent death, but it never happened. 

In 2003, Dying Fetus re-appeared with a new album, ""Stop At Nothing"", and a completely new line-up (only John Gallagher remained). Incredibly enough, even though basically a totally different band, all of the elements that made Dying Fetus such a great group were present in the new release and for someone that didn't know the facts, it would seem that nothing ever changed in the line-up.

                                        E-Rotic is a German commercial Eurodance act, originally established back in 1994 by Lyane Leigh and Raz-Ma-Taz AKA [A=Richard Michael Smith]. Lyane and Richard had an irreconcilable argue with their manager and left the group to establish their own dance act called S*E*X* Appeal in 1996. It remained a secured secret that Lyane, even if no longer with the group, was still giving her voice to E-Rotic. She can be heard on all releases until ""Gimme Gimme Gimme"" released in 2000. Lydia Madajewski then took over the vocal duties.

It was revealed recently (and confirmed) that David Brandes was the real voice of every E-Rotic rappers, apart from the very first single.
The rumour is that the first single rap was done by Michael J. Gibbs but that was never confirmed.
Jeanette Christensen was hired to lipsync the parts sung by Lyane Leigh and rapper Terence d'Arby was hired to lipsync the rapping of David Brandes.

Around October 1996, Terence d'Arby left the group and was ""replaced"" by another frontman: Ch√© Jouaner.
Jeanette Christensen left the group in 2001, followed by Yasemin 2002 and Lydia Madajewski in 2004.
After their great success in Europe in the mid-90's, E-Rotic had a relative success in Japan.

In 2015 E-rotic made a comeback for the liveshows with Lyane Leigh and a new rapper, Stephen Appleton.

Died : April 17, 1960 //    Chippenham, Wiltshire, UK 
An extraordinarily talented guitarist, singer and songwriter of the rock and roll era. His music influenced later artists such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who and many others.

Cochran's parents moved from Oklahoma City to Albert Lea, Minnesota, where he was born. The family moved back to Oklahoma briefly, before finally settling in Bell Gardens, LA, California.

As an LA teenager Cochran became a talented musician, with a circle of friends that included Connie 'Guybo' Smith- who's nickname would later become one of his song titles. Influenced by the works of Merle Haggard & Hank Williams he teamed up with Hank Cochran (unrelated), playing dance halls, fairs and schools as they were too young to play in 'redneck bars'.

They later called themselves The Cochran Brothers, touring the south-western states and appearing on the 'California Hayride' show. They recorded two 'hillbilly' records with Ekko Records in 1955 and did a promotional tour, meeting Elvis Presley on the Dallas 'Big D Jamboree' show. The duo auditioned for Sun Records in Memphis but split up shortly after making ""Fool's Paradise""- their third recording on Ekko- a song that shows a strong Presley influence, assisted by the co-writing of Jerry Capehart.

In 1956 Cochrane teamed up with Capehart and was signed to Liberty in 1957, although he still appeared on the labels of friends Capehart and Sylvester Cross- spending time in LA's Gold Star studio producing, writing and recording backing vocals on labels such as Crest, Zephyr, Crash, Vik, along with Silver, on which he recorded ""Guybo""- also known as 'Drum City'. He also appeared in two films.

Following up on his increasing American success Cochran toured the UK in 1960, joining up with Gene Vincent and Ronnie Hawkins to appear on popular TV & radio shows and the concert hall circuit. His girlfriend, songwriter Sharon Shari Sheeley, later joined them. The tour was a resounding success.

On Sunday 17th April - the day following the tour- Cochran, Vincent and Sheeley were on their way to the airport to return to the United States in the back seat of a car (also occupied by deputy tour manager Patrick Tompkins in the front seat), driven by hired taxi-driver George Martin. The vehicle left the road and hit a lampost. Sheeley suffered a broken pelvis but managed to fully recover. Vincent suffered broken ribs & collarbone and sustained injuries to an already weak leg that left him with a limp for the rest of his life. Cochran died in hospital that day from severe head injuries aged 21. 

Eerily, Cochran had just released a single, co-written with brother Bob Cochran, entitled ""Three Steps to Heaven."" It reached No. 1 in the charts, helping rock 'n roll come of age in the UK.

                                        An American country music singer with 146 songs on the country charts (including 28 number one hits), Arnold ranks among the most popular country singers in U.S. history.  He has sold over 85 million records, making him one of the most successful artists of the 20th century.

Early in his career, Eddy was the lead male vocalist for the Pee Wee King band.  By 1943 Arnold had become a solo star on the Grand Ole Opry.  He had a folksy nickname ""The Tennessee Plowboy.""  He successfully made the transition from radio to television, appearing frequently on all of the major television shows of the era.  He was the first country star to have his own television show, ""Eddy Arnold Time"".

Arnold's record sales dipped in the late 1950s due to the arrival of Rock and Roll.  He continued to try to court a wider audience by using pop-sounding, string-laced arrangements, a style that would come to be known as the Nashville sound. 

In 1966, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. In 1967, he was the first Entertainer of the Year named by the Country Music Association and in 1985 he received the Academy of Country Music's Pioneer Award.

Arnold published his autobiography, It's A Long Way From Chester County, in 1969.  His 100th album, ""After All These Years"", was released in 2005 by RCA Records.

Eddy performed his final concert on May 16, 1999, the day after his 81st birthday, at the Hotel Orleans in Las Vegas.

""Crimson"" was released in 1996 and it featured Mikael √Ökerfeldt of Opeth and the album contained progressive references. 1997's ""Infernal"", however, returned to the death metal roots. Shortly after the band went on their first tour since 1991, but unfortunatly Dan Swan√∂ left the band. He was replaced by Robert Karlsson. ""Cryptic"" was released same year.  In 1999 the compilation ""Evolution"" was released and shortly after the band broke up.

In 2003 Dan Swan√∂ resurrected Edge of Sanity and recorded ""Crimson II"" with the help from guitarists Mike Wead and Simon Johansson. Roger Johansson provided lead growls and Jonas Granvik took care of the backing growls and Dan Swan√∂ himself did some growls and took care of clean vocals, keyboard, drums and lead-guitar.

edith-piaf,"
                                        French singer and cultural icon. 

Born: 19 December 1915 in Paris, France. 
Died: 11 October 1963 in Plascassier, France. 

Best known for singing songs ""La Vie En Rose"", composed by Louiguy, with lyrics by Piaf, and English lyrics adapted by Mack David; and ""Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien"" written by Michel Vaucaire, which rather fittingly she sung just two years before the end of her eventful life. 

In 1935 Piaf was discovered in the Pigalle area of Paris by nightclub owner Louis Lepl√©e, whose club Le Gerny off the Champs-√âlys√©es was frequented by the upper and lower classes alike. He persuaded her to sing despite her extreme nervousness, which, combined with her height of only 142 centimetres (4 ft 8 in), inspired him to give her the nickname that would stay with her for the rest of her life and serve as her stage name, La M√¥me Piaf (Parigot translatable as ""The Waif Sparrow"", ""The Little Sparrow"", or ""Kid Sparrow""). Lepl√©e taught her the basics of stage presence and told her to wear a black dress, later to become her trademark apparel. Lepl√©e ran an intense publicity campaign leading up to her opening night, attracting the presence of many celebrities, including actor Maurice Chevalier. Her nightclub gigs led to her first two records produced that same year, with one of them penned by Marguerite Monnot, a collaborator throughout Piaf's life.

On 6 April 1936, Lepl√©e was murdered and Piaf was questioned and accused as an accessory, but was acquitted. Lepl√©e had been killed by mobsters with previous ties to Piaf. A barrage of negative media attention now threatened her career. To rehabilitate her image, she recruited Raymond Asso, with whom she would become romantically involved. He changed her stage name to ""√âdith Piaf"", barred undesirable acquaintances from seeing her, and commissioned Monnot to write songs that reflected or alluded to Piaf's previous life on the streets.

In 1940, √âdith co-starred in Jean Cocteau's successful one-act play Le Bel Indiff√©rent. She began forming friendships with prominent people, including Chevalier and poet Jacques Borgeat. She wrote the lyrics of many of her songs and collaborated with composers on the tunes. In 1944, she discovered Yves Montand in Paris, made him part of her act, and became his mentor and lover. Within a year, he became one of the most famous singers in France, and she broke off their relationship when he had become almost as popular as she was.

During this time she was in great demand and very successful in Paris as France's most popular entertainer. After the war, she became known internationally, touring Europe, the United States, and South America. In Paris, she gave Atahualpa Yupanqui (H√©ctor Roberto Chavero)‚Äîthe most important Argentine musician of folklore‚Äîthe opportunity to share the scene, making his debut in July 1950. She helped launch the career of Charles Aznavour in the early 1950s, taking him on tour with her in France and the United States and recording some of his songs. At first she met with little success with U.S. audiences, who regarded her as downcast. After a glowing review by a prominent New York critic, however, her popularity grew, to the point where she eventually appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show eight times and at Carnegie Hall twice (1956 and 1957).

√âdith Piaf's signature song ""La vie en rose"" was written in 1945 and was voted a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1998.

Bruno Coquatrix's famous Paris Olympia music hall is where Piaf achieved lasting fame, giving several series of concerts at the hall, the most famous venue in Paris, between January 1955 and October 1962. Excerpts from five of these concerts (1955, 1956, 1958, 1961, 1962) were issued on record and CD and have never been out of print. The 1961 concerts were promised by Piaf in an effort to save the venue from bankruptcy and where she debuted her song ""Non, je ne regrette rien"". In April 1963, Piaf recorded her last song, ""L'homme de Berlin"".

She was married to Jacques Pills between 1952 and 1956, and to Th√©o Sarapo from 1962 until her death in 1963.

                                        Alternative rock band from, Bury, Greater Manchester, England. Formed in 1990, originally called Mr. Soft (later shortened to Soft) and comprised of guitarist and back up vocalist Mark Potter, bassist Pete Turner and drummer Richard Jupp.  Vocalist, guitarist and lyricist Guy Garvey was asked by Mark to join the band when they met at college (both were 16 at the time). Mark's brother keyboardist and back up vocalist Craig Potter joined soon afterwards.  

They changed their name to Elbow in 1997 after Guy heard a character from a BBC TV Drama ""The Singing Detective"" say that the word ""Elbow"" is the most sensual word in the English language, not for it's definition, but for how it feels to say and how it looks on the page.  

They were also signed by Island Records in 1997, but due to a takeover and indie band jettison-attitude by Universal in 1998, their Steve Osborne produced debut album was scrapped.  Only a self-issued (now) ultra rare E.P. and a compilation appearance of one of the songs document this period.  

In 2000 they put out their first release proper, an E.P. on a small indie label Ugly Man Records before they were eventually signed to Richard Branson's V2 in 2001.  

Winner of the 2008 Mercury Prize (for best British album) for The Seldom Seen Kid.

                                        Elizabeth Cotten (January 5, 1895 ‚Äì June 29, 1987) was a self taught blues and folk musician, singer and songwriter from Carrboro, North Carolina.  She developed her own style of playing left-handed by holding a normally tuned guitar upside down so she played the melodies with her thumb and the bass lines with her fingers.  Her style of playing became known as ""Cotten picking"".

Cotten wrote most of her music in her early teens and earlier (she wrote Freight Train at age 11). After marrying at 15 and getting work as a maid she stopped playing music for 40 years.  It wasn't until she was working as a maid for Charles Seeger, an avid music lover, that she relearned how to play the guitar.

In the 50s Mike Seeger began to record Cotten on reel to reel tape. In 1960 she began to play live for the first time, her first show was with Mike Seeger and she went on to perform with musicians such as Mississippi John Hurt, John Lee Hooker, and Muddy Waters.  Because of the positive reaction Cotten began to write, record and tour with new material which she continued to do into her 80s.  In 1984 she won the Grammy ""Best Ethnic or Traditional Recording"" for the album Live!.

Elizabeth died when she was 92 in Syracuse, New York.

Died: 24 May 1974 in New York City, New York, USA (aged 75). 

""Art is dangerous. It is one of the attractions: when it ceases to be dangerous you don't want it."" Duke Ellington. 

Ellington was an outstanding composer. He wrote thousands of works, composing popular songs, art songs, a wide variety of instrumentals, suites, symphonic works, movie and TV scores, and music for ballet ‚Äì all of a very high quality. 

But to say merely that Ellington was a great composer ignores his achievement as a musician. Ellington is probably the only musician whose name has been associated with a particular style ""Ellingtonia"". This style does not imply a specific tempo or specific mood, but also a certain standard of quality. Whoever plays ""Ellingtonia"" must adhere to these standards. Many significant bands have attempted to copy his style. 

For Jazz, Ellington was the first orchestra leader to substitute voices for instruments, he popularized the Baritone Sax when he engaged Harry Carney, he influenced countless bands and dance orchestras. 

Beginning with his ""Jungle Band"" to his ""Famous Orchestra"" which appeared at Carnegie Hall numerous times and even introduced several Jazz suite that Duke had composed, Ellington his the most successful and important orchestra leader in Jazz history. Success did not come easily taking him many years of devoted work to make a name for himself. 

He began as a Ragtime pianist in his hometown of Washington. His first composition was ""Soda Fountain Rag"" which he never recorded. In 1922 he led a fairly successful band which featured Sonny Greer and Otto Hardwick. Several years later, when he opened at the New York Kentuky Club he succeeded in capture the public fancy. This was the first band to capture the now legendary Ellington sound which is clearly present in the number ""The Creeper"", recorded at the end of 1926. 

On 12 April 1927, Duke & his orchestra began the engagement which was to make him world famous: Irvin Mills brought them to the Cotton Club, where they stayed five years. There he laid the Jungle, the Mood and other styles. From December 1926 to October 1930 the Ellington band spent at least 64 days in the studios of 14 recording companies, using 18 different pseudonyms for his band, they recorded about 170 titles. 

He is also the father of Mercer Ellington.

                                        Eluveitie means ""The Helvetian"" in Gaulish and it is pronounced as ""El-Vey-Ti""

Eluveitie clearly belongs to the fastly growing folk/pagan metal scene, anyhow brings some ""fresh wind"" into it: Eluveities sound is authentic, traditional Celtic folk music combined in a unique way with modern styled melodic death metal, influenced by the classic Gothenburg sound.

Originally formed by mastermind Chrigel Glanzmann in Winter 2002/2003 as a mere studio project, the first MCD ""V√™n"" was recorded in spring 2003 - already unique in it's way of having folk music on an equal footing with the metal sound. 
The self-financed MCD was ardently received by scene and press and sold out within a few months. In 2004 Eluveitie signed to the Dutch label Fear Dark Records, which released a re-mastered (and partly re-recorded) version of ""V√™n"", and continued as a ""real"" band, playing gigs together with bands such as Finntroll, Amon Amarth, Korpiklaani, Ensiferum and many others while touring Europe and playing many festivals & openairs. 

Although some lineup changes still had to happen, Eluveitie grew into being a band and developed their very own style. In late 2005 Eluveitie was finally ready to enter the studio again and record their first full-length album ""Spirit"", which was again released through Fear Dark Records. Furthermore a video for the Song ""Of Fire, Wind & Wisdom"" was produced in Summer 2006, directed by Martin Sch√§ppi, Merlin Sutter & Chrigel Glanzmann / Eluveitie. 

With ""Spirit"" Eluveitie went a big step forward, presenting a completely new style of Folk Metal to the scene - starting a new wave of Folk Metal! 
While the album was turning out to be a huge success, the band toured their asses off again. Yet whilst touring and playing many festivals like the Graspop Metal Meeting (Belgium) or Summerbreeze Open Air (Germany), Eluveitie already began to work on new material for the succesive album. 

Finally in Fall 2007 the new album ""Slania"" was recorded in different studios in Sweden, Switzerland & Liechtenstein, produced, mixed & mastered by Jens Bogren (Amon Amarth, Opeth & more) at the Fascination Street Studios in Orebr√∂/SE (www.fascinationstreet.se). Having recorded nothing less than the perfection of their very own style, Eluveitie now was in the lucky Situation to receive many offers from almost every known label in metal music & ended up signing with the well-known German record company Nuclear Blast Records, where a new home was found under perfect conditions.... After some talks & the production of a new video (again produced & directed by Merlin Sutter & Martin Sch√§ppi) a release date was set for February 2008. 

‚ÄúSlania‚Äù turned out to become a breakthrough and the band was getting busy taking over the world in 2008 - with appearances at most of the bigger European summer festivals as well as two USA/Canada tours and three European tours within only 12 months. 

But never being lazy, Eluveitie worked out new material while touring and was ready to enter the studio again in December 2008! Their follow-up album to ‚ÄúSlania‚Äù should become something special - for it is the bands first purely acoustic album (and part I of a two-pieced acoustic concept). ‚ÄúEvocation I - The Arcane Dominion‚Äù was released in April 2009 and turned out to become a real gem of folk music and again became a huge success (rank 20 in the Swiss album charts).

Emperor were the first Norwegian black metal group to include symphonic keyboard arrangements and orchestration in their music, which soon made them one of the most influential bands in the whole black metal scene. During their 10-year career Emperor recorded four full-length albums, with which their music developed increasingly more technical and complex, reaching its peak on the ""Prometheus"" album. Emperor disbanded in 2001, but they have done selected reunion appearances over the years. First one was in 2005-2007, when they did few festival dates and brief US tours. In 2013-2014 Emperor reunited with the original drummer Faust (B√•rd Eithun) to celebrate the 20th anniversary of ""In The Nightside Eclipse"" album. The most recent 2017 festival reunion shows focus on celebrating the 20th anniversary of their second album ""Anthems To The Welkin At Dusk"".

Steele had previously worked with Pnau on ""With You Forever,"" a track from the band's 2007 self-titled third album, and the pair enjoyed collaborating so much that they started their own project, drawing inspiration from the likes of Phoenix and Daft Punk.

In fall 2008, Empire of the Sun released their debut album Walking On A Dream, which the musicians described as ""a spiritual road movie."" Featuring songs co-written by Pnau's other half, Peter Mayes, the album went platinum in Australia. The Steele-led band performed live for the first time at the Parklife tour in September and October 2009, while Empire of the Sun garnered 11 ARIA award nominations including Album Of The Year and Single Of The Year.

After their 2002 album ""Weiland"" the band decided to stop recording. As Schwadorf himself put it, ""Empyrium has explored nature-mystics since 1994, and after 8 years we feel to move on and made a glorious farewell to the concept with Weiland"".

On September 17, 2010, Prophecy Productions and Schwadorf personally announced that the band had reunited and revealed plans to release a new album soon, beside contributing to the label's upcoming v/a compilation Whom The Moon A Nightsong Sings. In June 2011, Empyrium played their first-ever live show at the Wave Gotik Treffen in Leipzig, Germany. 

Twelve years after their last studio effort ‚ÄúWeiland‚Äù, Empyrium published a new studio album, ‚ÄúThe Turn Of The Tides‚Äù.

The following year, Jari M√§enp√§√§ joined as a vocalist (and second guitarist) and the first self-titled demo was released. 

Before releasing their second demo tape in 1999, Jukka-Pekka Miettinen replaced Sauli Savolainen on bass and ex-Arthemesia drummer Oliver Fokin swapped positions with Kimmo Miettinen. The band continued playing and recorded a third demo, ""Hero in a Dream"", which was noticed by underground (and non) magazines which allowed the band to gain popularity and sign a deal with Spinefarm Records. 

Finally, Meiju Enho joined as keyboard player for the band and they were now able to record their epic, self-titled debut ""Ensiferum"" in 2001.

                                        Enter Shikari are an English four-piece rock band formed in 2003 in St Albans, Hertfordshire. They are known for their crossover style incorporating post-hardcore and various heavy metal sub-genres, such as metalcore and alternative metal, with elements of various electronic genres, such as industrial, dubstep, trance, and occasionally drum and bass, creating a very distinct sound. The band is named after a boat belonging to Roughton ""Rou"" Reynolds' uncle, and a character in a play which he wrote before forming the band, both of which are named Shikari. Their debut album, Take to the Skies, was released on 19 March 2007 and reached No. 4 in the Official UK Album Chart. Their second album, titled Common Dreads, was released on 15 June 2009 and debuted on the UK Albums Chart at 16. Their third studio album, A Flash Flood of Colour, was released on 16 January 2012 and was positioned at the top of the UK Album Chart for almost its entire week of release, however it eventually debuted on the chart at 4. The band then spent considerable time supporting the release through the A Flash Flood of Colour World Tour, before beginning work on their fourth studio album, The Mindsweep, released on January 2015 and debuted on the UK Albums Chart at 6.

They continued to refine their jazz versus electronica sound through eight studio albums until they gained larger exposure in 1994 through a collaboration with Massive Attack on ""Protection"" and their hit album ""Amplified Heart."" The Todd Terry remix of ""Missing"" was a smash hit in 1995 and continues to be remixed and played to this day. After the success of ""Missing"", the duo took their music in a more beat-oriented and clubbier direction, with Tracey lending her vocals as guest singer on several club tracks by Deep Dish and others. Their latest musical outing was a volume in the DMC ""Back To Mine"" series in late 2001. The duo got their name from a furniture store ad which proclaimed, ""For your bedroom needs, we have everything but the girl.""

                                        Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) band formed in 1980 in San Francisco, CA.

Formed by guitarist Kirk Hammett & drummer Tom Hunting (who initially handled vocals as well). The group was rounded out by guitarist Tim Agnello and bassist Carlton Melson. The line up shifted several times in the early years.

1982 - 1985

In 1982, Exodus included Kirk Hammett and Gary Holt on guitars, Paul Baloff on lead vocals, Geoff Andrews on bass and drummer Tom Hunting. This lineup recorded the band's 1982 demo.

In 1983, founding member Kirk Hammett left Exodus to join Metallica and was replaced by guitarist Rick Hunolt and Rob McKillop replaced Andrews on bass. This line-up recorded and released their debut album, ""Bonded by Blood"" in 1984 (released in 1985).

1986 - 1991

Shortly before the recording of ""Pleasures of the Flesh"" in 1987, Paul Baloff was replaced by Steve ""Zetro"" Souza, who had previously been the lead vocalist for the San Francisco band Legacy (later known as Testament). Baloff later went on to form the band Piranha.

In 1989, the band released ""Fabulous Disaster"" which garnered good press and, eventually, a major label deal.  That same year, Tom Hunting departed, leaving the group with no founding members.  In 1991 the band released their first live effort, ""Good Friendly Violent Fun"", which featured new bassist Mike Butler.

1991 - 1998

After the release of ""Good Friendly Violent Fun"", the band toured sporadically for a year and released another studio album, ""Force of Habit"". This album was a departure for the band, containing several slower, ""heavier"" songs with less emphasis on the speed/thrash basis of their older material.  Unable to match the commercial success of some of their peers and dealing with internal stresses and problems, Exodus split in 1993.

After a few dormant years, Exodus released only another live album in 1997 titled ""Another Lesson in Violence"" and featuring the return of vocalist Paul Baloff and new bassist Jack Gibson. Exodus disintegrated again, partly due to a falling out with record label Century Media over the way the live album was promoted, and over an aborted attempt at a live concert video which was filmed but never released due to a financial dispute.

2001 - 2004

In 2001, Exodus reformed again, initially to play the Chuck Billy benefit, the ""Thrash of the Titans"" mega concert. There was talk of recording a new studio album and the band continued to play local gigs in and around the San Francisco Bay Area. In February 2002, Paul Baloff suffered a seizure/stroke from which he eventually died. Former vocalist Steve Souza was recruited back into the band to finish the rest of their concert commitments.

Although it appeared to outsiders that with Baloff's death Exodus would cease to exist, guitarist Gary Holt was determined to release a new studio record. The result was 2004's ""Tempo of the Damned"" released on Nuclear Blast.

2005 - Present

In 2005, Hunolt decided to leave the band to concentrate on his family life. He was replaced by Heathen guitarist Lee Altus. Tom Hunting also left, citing strong personal objections over some of Holt's anti-Christian lyrics as well as anxiety issues. Hunting was replaced with Paul Bostaph who had previously played with Forbidden, Slayer and Testament.  Souza also left under disputed terms in 2005. 
He was replaced intitially by Steev Esquivel (ex-Defiance and Skinlab) and then later by Rob Dukes whose first recorded performance for the band is 2005's ""Shovel Headed Kill Machine"". 

Tom Hunting returned to the band in March 2007.  In 2012, Rick Hunolt returned in a guest role, filling in for Gary Holt on several live dates while Holt toured with Slayer.  In 2014, Steve Souza returned to the group.

                                        Formed in 1984, Miami-based Expos√© (originally X-Posed) was the brainchild of dance music producer Lewis A. Martine√©. The all-girl trio consisted of Sandra ‚ÄúSandee‚Äù Casanas, Al√©jandra ‚ÄúAl√©‚Äù Lorenzo and Laurie Miller. 

After just two singles, ‚ÄúExposed To Love‚Äù and ‚ÄúPoint Of No Return,‚Äù both of which became major club hits, Expos√© split up. Al√© and Sandee embarked on solo careers, and Sandee had great club success with her solo album ‚ÄúOnly Time Will Tell‚Äù, which included the dance smash ‚ÄúNotice Me‚Äù. 

When it came time to record a third single, ‚ÄúCome Go With Me‚Äù, an entirely new lineup, Ann Curless, Jeanette Jurado and Gioia Bruno, was brought together by Martine√©.

The album ‚ÄúExposure‚Äù was released in 1987 and sold over two-million copies and reached the top 20. The album was released with the original versions of ""Point Of No Return"" and ""Exposed To Love,"" with the vocals of Al√© Lorenzo et al intact. Martine√© chose to re-record and re-release ""Point Of No Return"" with the new vocalists, and the song was a hit once again.

Expos√© released a second successful album in 1989, ""What You Don't Know,"" and had many more hits.  But in 1992 Gioia left the trio due to health reasons. She was replaced by Kelly Moneymaker for a self-titled release later that same year, but the album didn't make much of an impact and the group broke up. 

Gioia has since released several solo singles and a solo album, called Expose This.

With an original new sound and groundbreaking records, the foursome was immediately recognized as innovators in the world of rock & roll. The band has described their music as ‚ÄúFunky Metal‚Äù in the early days, but it would evolve much more in the mid-90s by blending classic rock influences with post-grunge and alternative rock.

Previously the trio played in a band known as Zero Tolerance along with guitarist Mark Haake.  Prior to Zero Tolerance, Trever and Matt played in a band named Victoria Manor, which disbanded in the late 80‚Äôs.  

Face to Face's first album, Don‚Äôt Turn Away, was released in 1992 by Dr. Strange Records, a small independent label located in Alta Loma, California. After nine studio albums and a dedicated following, arguably the band is most well known for their single, ""Disconnected,"" which was released on the band‚Äôs first two albums and received significant airplay on college radio. 

During the bands 25-year career, Keith had been the only constant member with many former band members finding success in other bands. Former drummer, Pete Parada is the current drummer for The Offspring and former bassist Matt Riddle had success in No Use For A Name and currently plays with The Implants. 

The band currently consists of Trever on vocals and guitar with guitarist Dennis Hill filling out the rhythm section. Scott Shiflett is the band's bassist and has been a member of the band since Riddle‚Äôs departure in late 1995. Finally, veteran drummer Danny Thompson has been behind the kit since the band reformed in 2008.

Jamie Catto was originally part of the group but left after the release of the second album ""Sunday 8PM"". Zo√´ Johnston joined for the album ""Outrospective"".

Critics may have been harsh, but the group kept moving forward with all members also pursuing solo careers on the side.

His first original single, Mahakarya Cinta, a song composed by Audi Mok, made its debut in the Grand Finale of One in a Million. He finished as runner-up to Suki Low. Faizal released a single, Kasih Tercipta, as part of the soundtrack for the local film Waris Jari Hantu. He was also named as the sole Malaysian spokesperson for DC Superheroes clothing, as he was famously noted for wearing T-shirts with the Superman logo throughout One in a Million.

Controversy	Edit
On 13 January 2008 Faizal created controversy by removing his shirt to bare his chest and also his belt ""live"" on television during 8TV's fourth anniversary concert. 8TV's management took action by giving him strict warnings and requiring him to be involved in charity work for six months. In addition, two days after the incident 8TV held a press conference where Faizal apologized to all who were offended by the stunt.[2] As a result, on 19 January, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) stated that it would ban him from appearing on television for three months, and also bar 8TV from airing live or tape-delayed entertainment programmes throughout the same period, effective 15 January.[3] Days after the end of the ban, the Mufti of Perlis, Dato' Dr. Asri Zainul Abidin, issued a grievance[clarification needed] to TV3 against having Faizal perform at the Konsert Jom Heboh, which was held in the first weekend of May.[4]

Iwan Fals (born 3 September 1961 in Jakarta as Virgiawan Listanto) is an Indonesian singer and songwriter. He has released more than 35 albums of mostly solo guitar-based material in a style said to be influenced by Bob Dylan. He is considered a popular singer in the country. He is known as a social observer and protest singer, although he has sung many songs about love and romance.

He is married (his wife's name is Rosana) with three children: Galang Rambu Anarki, Annisa Cikal Rambu Bassae and Raya Rambu Rabbani. His eldest son, Galang Rambu Anarki, died in April 1997 of asthma. Iwan Fals had previously written an eponymously titled song for him on his birth in 1982.

                                        Family Force 5 (often abbreviated FF5, formerly known as The Phamily and The Brothers) is a Christian Rapcore band from Atlanta, Georgia.

The three leading members of the band, Solomon, Jacob and Joshua, are all three sons of Jerome Olds, a Christian artist from the late 1980s. Growing up around music, the Olds brothers have been involved in it since a very young age.

Family Force 5 uses elements of Rap, Post-hardcore, and club oriented Crunk. The band often cites their own style as Crunk rock. Most songs contain heavy use of synthesizers and simple power chord riffs. Some songs make references to break dancing, the fact that they grew up in Atalanta, and the song Supersonic spells out the word Crunk in the lyrics.

Cook adopted the new pseudonym Fatboy Slim in 1996. The Fatboy Slim album and Cook's second solo album Better Living Through Chemistry (released through Skint Records) contained the Top 40 UK hit, ""Everybody Needs a 303"".
Fatboy Slim's next work was the single ""The Rockafeller Skank"", released prior to the album You've Come a Long Way, Baby, both of which were released in 1998. ""Praise You"", also from this album, was Cook's first UK solo number one. Its music video, starring Spike Jonze, won numerous awards.
In 2000, Fatboy Slim released his third studio album, Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars, and featured two collaborations with Macy Gray and ""Weapon of Choice"", which also was made into an award-winning video starring Christopher Walken.
In 2003, he produced Crazy Beat and Gene by Gene from the Blur album Think Tank, and in 2004, Palookaville was Cook's first studio album for four years.
Fatboy Slim's greatest hits album Why Try Harder was released on 19 June 2006. It comprises eighteen tracks, including ten Top 40 singles, a couple of Number Ones and two exclusive new tracks ‚Äì ""Champion Sound"" and ""That Old Pair of Jeans"". Most of the songs were shortened and heavily edited, resulting in almost fifteen minutes of unused space on the compact disc release. (wikipedia - edited)

Not simply a DJ, Norman Cook has surpassed this role as a producer whilst using one of many aliases; the chief one being Fatboy Slim. 
Many UK DJ's have managed to crossover to a large extent in the US and beyond, however Norman Cook, under alias Fatboy Slim, has done much more than this. 
Rather than being a faceless behind the decks head-down DJ, Norman's exuberant character whilst performing on the decks simply takes any audience with him regardless of the country or culture he is playing to. 

His devotion to his chosen place of residence, Brighton, is legendary, even donning ""I Love Brighton"" T-shirts on occasion. Despite massive pressure to go wholly with a major label, he continues to stick with his original Brighton-based label Skint Records. He also has put-on two massive free beach parties on Brighton beach, as a thanks to the love and respect fellow residents of the city have given him. 
On New Years Day 2007, he held the third beach event. Whilst it was forced to be scaled down and ticketed --due to Brighton City Council's heath & safety concerns-- this event shows his devotion to Brighton remains undiminished. 
He staged a fourth event on Saturday 27 September 2008, ""Big Beach Boutique 4"" for Brighton residents only, just in time for the end of summer.

One of the most popular jazz performers of his era.

Thomas Wright Waller was the youngest of four children born to Adaline Locket Waller and the Reverend Edward Martin Waller. He started playing the piano when he was six and graduated to the organ of his father's church four years later. At the age of fourteen he was playing the organ at Harlem's Lincoln Theater and within twelve months he had composed his first rag. Waller's first piano solos (""Muscle Shoals Blues"" and ""Birmingham Blues"") were recorded on October 1922 in Race Records when he was 18 years old.

He was the prize pupil, and later friend and colleague, of stride pianist James P. Johnson. Fats Waller was the son of a preacher and learned to play the organ in church with his mother. Overcoming opposition from his clergyman father, Waller became a professional pianist at 15, working in cabarets and theaters. In 1918 he won a talent contest playing Johnson's ""Carolina Shout"", a song he learned from watching a player piano play it.

Waller contracted pneumonia and died on a cross country train trip near Kansas City, Missouri on December 15, 1943, after making a final recording session with an interracial group in Detroit that included white trumpeter Don Hirleman. He was on his way back to Hollywood for more film work, after the smash success of ""Stormy Weather"". Coincidentally, as the train with the body of Waller stopped in Kansas City, so stopped a train with his dear friend Louis Armstrong on board.

fear,"
                                        Fear is a punk rock band formed by vocalist/guitarist Lee Ving and bassist Derf Scratch in Los Angeles, CA, in 1977.  The band is known for their controversial lyrics, which are, at times, sexist and/or homophobic, though this is usually meant more to be shocking than it is to be taken seriously.  Following the release of their first single, drummer Spit Stix and guitarist Philo Cramer joined the band and, for many, this constituted the ""classic"" Fear line-up.  The band's reputation grew after appearances in the movie ""The Decline Of The Western Civilization"" (where they antogonized a San Francisco crowd nearly to the point of riot) and on a 1981 episode of ""Saturday Night Live"" (where they appeared at the insistence of John Belushi; the band brought their own slam dancers and eventually the network cut away from the band mid-performance; for years, the episode remained one of their few SNL episodes that NBC refused to re-run).  

After the release of their first LP, ""The Record"", in 1982, Ving fired Scratch and the band went through a number of bass players, including Flea of Red Hot Chili Peppers fame (this line up, however, did not release any material).  In 1993, Spit Stix and Philo Cramer quit the band after a financial dispute with Lee Ving.  Ving returned in 1995 with a new line-up and a new Fear album.  A follow-up record appeared in 2001.  Ving continues to tour under the Fear banner with drummer Andrew Jaimez (who joined in 1995) and a number of different guitarists and bassists.

                                        Fear, And Loathing In Las Vegas is a japanese post-hardcore/screamo/electronica band.

The band was originally formed in the summer of 2008 by the former members of Ending for a start and Blank Time.

The band mainly plays heavy music with both high and low shouts, but unlike typical metal sounds, they have electronic beats and clean singing.

The audacious and unique fusion of heavy music and various electronic sounds produced by the keyboard had facinated many audiences.

Spending much time searching for a clean vocalist, So (ex. Bombreligion) joined in the spring of 2009 as their 6th member.

Since then, they released 3 singles, 1 mini-album and 1 album. A new album, All That We Want, will be released on August 8, 2012.

                                        Fear Factory were formed in 1989 in Los Angeles by Dino Cazares (guitar), Raymond Herrera (drums), Burton C. Bell (vocals) and later Christian Olde Wolbers (bass) under the name Ulceration before switching in 1990 to their current moniker.

Influenced by British Grindcore and extreme music such as Napalm Death and Godflesh, Fear Factory's career has seen them pioneer a hybrid of Death Metal, Industrial Metal, Alternative Metal and electronic music.

Their first album ""Concrete"" from 1991 was not released until 2002. This was also the first production job for then unknown Ross Robinson who would later produce bands such as Korn, Machine Head or Slipknot.

Strong personal differences led to a break-up in 2002 but the band re-formed a year later minus Cazares with bassist Christian Olde Wolbers taking on guitar duties while Strapping Young Lad's Byron Stroud entered to take over live bass. Another hiatus followed in 2006.

In 2009 Fear Factory returned with founding member Cazares in the band again, but without Herrera and Wolbers.

                                        While his tenure as the frontman for the legendary Roxy Music remained his towering achievement, singer Bryan Ferry also carved out a successful solo career which continued in the lush, sophisticated manner perfected on the group's final records. Born September 26, 1945 in Washington, England, Ferry, the son of a coal miner, began his musical career as a singer with the rock outfit the Banshees while studying art at the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne under pop-conceptualist Richard Hamilton. He later joined the Gas Board, a soul group featuring bassist Graham Simpson; in 1970, Ferry and Simpson formed Roxy Music.

Within a few years, Roxy Music had become phenomenally successful, affording Ferry the opportunity to cut his first solo LP in 1973. Far removed from the group's arty glam-rock, These Foolish Things established the path which all of Ferry's solo work -- as well as the final Roxy Music records -- would take, focusing on elegant synth-pop interpretations of '60s hits like Bob Dylan's ""A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall,"" the Rolling Stones' ""Sympathy for the Devil"" and the Beatles' ""You Won't See Me,"" all rendered in the singer's distinct, coolly dramatic manner.

Roxy Music remained Ferry's primary focus, but in 1974 he returned with a second solo effort, Another Time, Another Place, another collection of covers ranging from ""You Are My Sunshine"" to ""It Ain't Me, Babe"" to ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes."" His third venture, 1976's Let's Stick Together, featured remixed, remade, and remodeled versions of Roxy Music hits as well as the usual assortment of covers. 1977's In Your Mind was Ferry's first solo collection of completely original material; the following year's The Bride Stripped Bare, a work rumoured to be inspired by his broken romance with model Jerry Hall, split evenly between new songs and covers.

Ferry did not release another solo album until 1985's Boys and Girls, a sleek, seamless effort that was his first ""official"" solo release following the Roxy breakup in 1983. Boys & Girls contained one of Ferry's best-known solo compositions, ""Slave To Love"".

1987's B√™te Noire displayed a similarly hazy, detailed yet rhythmic soundstage. A long world tour in 1988 and 1989 followed, after which he started recording another album of original material to be called Horoscope, which however developed into an overly complex project and was not released in its original form. Instead, Ferry released another album of re-interpretations in 1993, called Taxi, and re-worked the Horoscope tapes as well as adding new compositions. The result was the highly atmospheric and impressionistic Mamouna album, finally released in 1994, containing nine Ferry originals plus - unprecedentedly - a co-write with Brian Eno, who also performed on the album. Another world tour followed, likewise another delayed release: an album called Alphaville was recorded and produced with Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics, though Ferry eventually chose not to release it. Again, he resolved to re-interpreting other people's songs, this time classic material from the 30s and 40s (including standards by Cole Porter), and the album that ensued was 1999's warm, largely acoustic As Time Goes By. It was presented in live concerts throughout late 1999 and 2000. With more and more Roxy Music tracks being added to the setlist, it was one of the factors finally convincing Ferry to reunite with his former Roxy Music colleagues.

Shortly after the Roxy Music reunion tour, an album called Frantic emerged in 2002, collecting some of the original material planned for Alphaville in the mid-90s, albeit mostly in re-worked form, plus a number of cover versions. The album suggested comparisons to The Bride Stripped Bare, in its more rock-ist, guitar-laden sounds. Not having been inclined to large amounts of touring in earlier years, Ferry undertook another long agenda of live commitments. Only in 2007 did he release his next solo album, a collection of Dylan interpretations - appropriately named Dylanesque -, ranging from introspective, closely-miked ballads to more straightforward rock workouts.

finntroll,"
                                        Finntroll came together for the first time in 1998. The band featured numerous artists members of Moonsorrow, Barathrum, and Impaled Nazarene. The band members of Finntroll are guitarsist Somnium (Impaled Nazarene, Thy Serpent), Katla the vocalist, drummer B. Dominator (Barathrum, Rapture), √ñrmy on live guitars, Trollhorn (Moonsorrow) on keyboards and Tundra on bass. The band first made their demo tape, ""Rivfader"" in 1998, followed by their first full length CD, ""Midnattens Widunder"" in 1999. Despite being a Finnish band, Finntroll chooses to write their lyrics in Swedish being quite rough sounding. In 2001 they release Jaktens Tid their second full length CD. In 2003 they release a new CD with a new sound. Intended as experimental version before their next work, the band decided to record it anyway. 

Unfortunately, after the recording of the forementioned album, Finntroll was struck by the tragic death of the guitarist Teemu ""Somnium"" Raimoranta in March 2003. This didn't stop the band however. In 2004 they released the EP ""Trollhammaren"" and the album ""Nattf√∂dd"".

                                        Known for a theatrical style of introspective indie rock, Foxing brought together active members of the St. Louis, Missouri music scene in the early 2010s. With backgrounds that included post-rock, emo, and math rock bands, they expanded upon guitar-oriented fare with orchestral instruments beginning with their full-length debut, 2013's The Albatross.

Led by singer Conor Murphy, Foxing formed in 2011 after the dissolution of Hunter Gatherer, a post-rock project that had common members including bass player Josh Coll and drummer Jon Hellwig. Foxing issued an EP titled ""Old Songs"" in 2012. Their debut LP, ""The Albatross"", arrived in 2013 on indie label ""Count Your Lucky Stars Records"", and had strings, saxophones, and brass fleshing out their lush guitar palette. The lineup of Murphy, Coll, Hellwig, and guitarists Eric Hudson and Ricky Sampson soon signed with ""Triple Crown Records"", which released the band's second full-length, the similarly expansive ""Dealer"", in October 2015.

Nearer My God In 2017, Coll left the group to focus on filmmaking, and Murphy released a self-titled album under the solo moniker Smidley. With producer Chris Walla on board, the group reconvened as a four-piece for its third album, ""Nearer My God"", also issued by ""Triple Crown"".

He left the band in 1979 for a solo career. He withdrew from music in 1985 and concentrated on visual work. In 1990, inspired by acid house, Foxx briefly returned as Nation 12, a collaboration with Tim Simenon of Bomb The Bass (and later with the late Shem McCauley/Streets Ahead). Foxx then fell silent again until 1997, when a chance meeting with Louis Gordon led to a batch of albums by the duo (1997‚Äì2008) and a new phase of Foxx's solo career.

Beginning his musical career in the swing era with Harry James and Tommy Dorsey, Sinatra became a solo artist with great success in the early to mid-1940s. 

He signed with Capitol Records and released several critically lauded albums. Sinatra left Capitol to found his own record label, Reprise Records, toured internationally, and fraternized with the Rat Pack and President John F. Kennedy in the early 1960s. 

Sinatra had three children, Nancy Sinatra (singer, artist), Frank Sinatra Jr. (musician), and Tina Sinatra (TV producer), all with his first wife, Nancy Barbato (married 1939 to 1951). He was married three more times, to actresses Ava Gardner (1951 to 1957) and Mia Farrow (1966 to 1968), and finally to model/showgirl Barbara Marx (married 1976), to whom he was still married at his death.

                                        English group, formed in Liverpool, UK in 1980; comprised William ""Holly"" Johnson (vocals - b.February 19, 1960), Paul Rutherford (vocals, keyboards - b.December 8, 1959), Brian Nash (guitar - b.May 20, 1963), Peter Gill (drums - b.March 8, 1964) and Mark O'Toole (bass - b.January 6, 1964). 

Following an appearance on Channel 4 TV show ""The Tube"" performing ""Relax"", the group were signed up by Trevor Horn and Paul Morley's new ZTT record label. With the benefit of Horn's production skills and Morley's off-the-wall marketing ideas, ""Relax"" came out in October 1983 and slowly but surely took off. It was already a top ten hit when, in January 1984, BBC Radio 1 DJ Mike Read suddenly realised what the song was actually about, leading to a total BBC ban on the disc. From this moment on, Frankie Goes To Hollywood became not just a pop group but a phenomenon. The record went to number one in the UK, and was a smash hit across Europe and even in the USA. ""Frankie Says"" T-shirts (some dreamt up by Morley, but far more the creations of small-time bootleggers) became the fashion statement of the year, and anticipation was at such a fever pitch that every subsequent FGTH release that year - two singles and a double-LP - went straight in at number one in their home country, an unprecedented achievement and a triumph for ZTT.

Now established as huge stars in the UK and Europe (though like so many other ""British invasion"" acts they were doomed to One-hit Wonder status in the US), Frankie spent much of 1985 on tour before starting work on their second album, the Stephen Lipson-produced ""Liverpool"". Trailed by the popular single ""Rage Hard"", the album came out in October 1986... and flopped.

It was the beginning of the end for Frankie Goes To Hollywood - six months later, Johnson announced he was leaving the band for a solo contract with MCA. In the subsequent high-profile legal battle, ZTT lost their claim of contract-breaking against Johnson, a ruling which effectively brought the curtain down on the label's golden age. Rutherford quit too, leaving a diminished group who subsequently disbanded without releasing anything.

                                        Although Further Seems Forever never managed to retain a lead singer for more than one album, the Florida-based band wielded considerable influence in the emo arena, becoming one of the genre's most acclaimed bands despite maintaining a relatively low profile. Formed in Pompano Beach, the band first took its lineup from three local groups: Strongarm, Shai Hulud and  Vacant Andys. Vocalist Chris Carrabba fronted the outfit, while bassist Chad Neptune, drummer Steve Kleisath, and guitarists Josh Colbert and Nick Dominguez provided the rhythmic backbone. ""Vengeance Factor"", a song recorded for a Deep Elm compilation titled Emo Diaries, helped attract an early fan base, and a split EP with Recess Theory (From The 27th State) followed in July 1999. Embracing a mix of pop-influenced melodies, religious lyrics, and emocore tinges, Further Seems Forever released their full-length debut with 2001's Moon Is Down, on the Christian-affiliated Tooth & Nail label. The group soon changed singers when Carrabba decided to pursue a solo career as  Dashboard Confessional, an emo project that - unlike Further Seems Forever - would go on to enjoy both critical acclaim and mainstream success.

Further Seems Forever recruited former Affinity frontman Jason Gleason, and the revised band forged ahead with the new singer. Whereas Carrabba's vocals had sounded vulnerable and pained, Gleason's own voice emphasized intensity and a wide range. He was first introduced to fans when the new lineup appeared on two compilations, Rock Music: A Tribute To Weezer and Punk Goes Pop. Meanwhile, additional lineup changes took place as Derick Cordoba replaced Dominguez in time for February 2003's How To Start A Fire. A powerful effort, the sophomore album proved that Further Seems Forever were more than a pre-Dashboard vehicle for Chris Carrabba, who had already made a name for himself as a solo artist. As luck would have it, though, Gleason exited the group just as work on a third album was beginning.

Hide Nothing Undeterred, the rest of Further Seems Forever reached out to vocalist Jon Bunch, whose previous band, Sense Field, had recently dissolved. Bunch agreed to become the band's third frontman, and Hide Nothing introduced the new lineup in August 2004. The group supported its release by touring alongside  Sparta,  Copeland, and  The Starting Line, but by the following year, the musicians had shifted their priorities. Further Seems Forever went on a brief hiatus that November, with Neptune announcing his desire to focus on family matters instead. A formal breakup arrived in early 2006, punctuated by a farewell tour and the March release of Hope This Finds You Well, a career retrospective that included fan favorites, rarities, and B-sides. 567 Records then issued the CD/DVD The Final Curtain in early April 2007, which included unreleased material and footage of Further Seems Forever's last show on June 17, 2006. In 2010, Further Seems Forever reunited for several shows featuring original singer Carrabba. Two years later, Carrabba was still at the helm for the band's fourth studio album, Penny Black (Rise Records). Years passed until fans heard news of the band, who announced another reunion for a festival slot in early 2016. However, tragedy struck on February 1, 2016, when news broke that former singer Jon Bunch had suddenly died.

The album went on to become one of the most successful albums of the year, garnering sales of over 200,000 copies and winning the Mnet Asian Music Awards for Album of the Year. Heartbreaker also sparked major controversies for the artist, including accusations of plagiarism. After almost a year of hiatus, G-Dragon and bandmate, T.O.P collaborated to record and release the album GD & TOP (2010). The album saw the release of three singles: ""High High,"" ""Oh Yeah,"" and ""Knock Out,"" all of which have charted within the top three positions of the Gaon chart, with ""High High"" becoming a chart-topper.

In the early 1980s Rock producers Vig (Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins) and Marker founded Smart Studios, a recording studio in Madison, Wisconsin. Vig and musician friend Erikson formed the group Fire Town in the late 1980s, an offshoot from their disbanded band Spooner. Marker was their roadie. Vig and Marker began making electronic/rock mixes for artists like Nine Inch Nails and House of Pain. In 1993 they decided they wanted to form a band that employed the remix and genre-bending approach they experimented with earlier and began looking for a singer and fourth collaborator. Guitarist Steve Marker came across a video of Scottish band Angelfish played once on MTV's ""120 Minutes"". Struck by the lead singer's (Shirley Manson) voice, he informed the guys and their manager contacted Manson, inviting her to audition in Madison, Wisconsin. After an unsuccessful audition, Manson went back and began working on the then-sleketal versions of a few tracks. The band officially grouped in 1994, and released their self-titled debut in 1995. All four members are involved in songwriting and production.

gasolin,"
                                        As one of - if not the most successful and legendary rock bands in Danish rock history. Formed 1969 by Kim Larsen, Franz Beckerlee and Wili J√∏nsson. Shortly after Bj√∏rn Uglebjerg joined. He was replaced by S√∏ren Berlev in 1971. Their first single, ""Silky Sally"", was in English, and did not become a hit - but their self-titled Danish language debut album however became a modest success. Gasolin' had their prime time from 1972 to 1978, and released 8 studio albums and two live albums in that period plus two English versions albums of their 3rd and 5th studioalbum. Their major league commercial breakthrough came with the album ""Gas 5"" in 1975 and their 1976 ""Live S√•dan"" album is listed on the official Danish national cultural treasure list, ""Kulturkanonen"". The same year Gasolin' failed to break through in USA after releasing an English version of the record ""Gas 5"". This, and internal conflicts was the main reason for their split-up in 1978. Keyboardist Klaus Agerschou often appeared with the band in concert. 

Singer Kim Larsen simultaneously with Gasolin' played with his sidekicks Sylvester's Jukebox and Starfuckers and released a solo album in 1973. Post Gasolin' he has had a solo career just as successful as that of Gasolin'. Franz Beckerlee, who was a jazz saxophonist in the 60's, e.g. with The Contemporary Jazz Quartet, released one solo album post Gasolin' but also worked with writing and painting.

Geddy Lee plays bass, keyboards, and sings in progressive rock band Rush. Born in Toronto, Ontario, Lee grew up as the son of Polish Jewish refugees who had both been survivors of Nazi concentration camps Dachau and Bergen-Belsen. Lee's stage name (and later legal name) ""Geddy"" was inspired by the heavily-accented pronunciation of his given first name ""Gary"" by his grandmother. An award-winning musician, Lee's style, technique, and skill on the bass guitar have proven very influential in the rock and heavy metal genres, inspiring such players as Steve Harris of Iron Maiden, John Myung of Dream Theater, Les Claypool of Primus, and Metallica's Cliff Burton among others. In addition to his composing, arranging, and performing duties for Rush, Lee has produced albums for various other bands, including Rocket Science. Lee's first solo effort, ""My Favorite Headache"", was released in 2000. Along with his colleagues Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart, Lee was made an Officer of the Order of Canada on May 9, 1996. The trio were the first rock musicians so honored.

                                        Formed in 1967, Genesis are among the top 30 highest-selling recording artists of all time. 

Their early work is characterized by complex song structures, elaborate instrumentation and the theatrical antics of founder member and vocalist Peter Gabriel, who left the band in 1975. Unable to find a suitable replacement, it was drummer Phil Collins who assumed vocal duties. This change, as well as the departure of guitarist Steve Hackett, two years later, saw the remaining three members (Phil Collins, Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford) move into more accessible pop-based music. This change in style resulted in a huge growth in Genesis' popularity throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.

In 1996 Collins left to concentrate on his solo work and other projects, leaving erstwhile bandmates Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks to forge ahead with new recruit; Stiltskin vocalist Ray Wilson. This line-up lasted for one album only (1997's ""Calling All Stations"") and Genesis soon found itself on hiatus after the poor performance and critical reaction of the new album.

In 2006 - after years of speculation - Phil Collins, Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford reformed Genesis for the successful ""Turn It On Again"" tour. A reunion involving ex-members Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett remains much talked-about and unrealised.

                                        Formed : 1994 // Montreal, QC, Canada 
Godspeed You! Black Emperor is an experimental nine-piece from Montreal, Canada that specializes in instrumental music of haunting beauty. They've released six discs of music, with a grand total of fifteen pieces of music, so you know they can write some extended ideas. Formed in 1994, GYBE! consists of Roger Tellier-Craig (guitar), Norsola Johnson (cello), Efrim Menuck (guitar), Mauro Pezzente (bass), David Bryant (guitar), Thierry Amar (bass), Sophie Trudeau (violin), Aidan Girt (percussion), and Bruce Cawdron (percussion). GYBE!'s music could probably be described as long, dark and moody. Their sound was once compared to Tangerine Dream, except that GYBE! uses no keyboards. They paint a similar sonic texture to Tangerine Dream, but they do it using cello, violin, upright bass, and three guitars, rather than synths. In fact, GYBE! is very organic, often bringing in spoken word samples, as well as glockenspiel.
NB: 'Godspeed You Black Emperor!' was the band's name until the release of 'Yanqui U.X.O.', when they moved the exclamation mark to give 'Godspeed You! Black Emperor', a more correct translation of the Japanese biker documentary they got it from.

gorgoroth,"
                                        Gorgoroth of Norway was formed in 1992 by Hat (vocals), Goat (Drums) and Infernus (Guitar). Gorgoroth is taken from the book The Lord of the Rings and is a dark and lifeless field where evil dwells. The band has never officially published their lyrics, neither through album booklets nor other sources, online or otherwise.

In 1993 Gorgoroth released their first demo called ""A Sorcery Written in Blood"". A guy named Kjettar played bass on the demo, but left right after. They were later signed to Embassy Rec. where they later, in 1994, released their first full-length, ""Pentagram"". Samoth from Emperor joined and played bass on the album, however, after the release he and Goat left the band. 

In 1996 they were signed to a different label called Malicious Records, which re-released ""Pentagram"". Same year the band also released their 2nd album ""Antichrist"" and Frost from Satyricon played drums on this album. Infernus also dedicated this album to Euronymous of Mayhem. They later released the MCD ""The Last Tormentor"" where Grim (Immortal, Borknagar) replaced Frost and Ares (Aeternus) played bass. In 1997 they released ""Under the Sign of Hell"" which was not only the last album on Malicious Records, but also the last album with drummer Grim who died because of drug abuse. Gorgoroth were later signed with Nuclear Blast and released ""Destroyer"", and in 1998 they participated on the Darkthrone tribute ""Darkthrone Holy Darkthrone"" where they covered ""Slottet I Det Fjerne"". 

In 2000 they released ""Incipit Satan"" and in 2000 they covered ""Life Eternal"" on the Mayhem tribute album. They then released ""Twilight of the Idols (In Conspiracy with Satan)"" in 2003. In 2004 they played a live show in Krakow, Poland, which gave them quite some attention. Severed sheep heads and buckets of blood and guts were spilt on the floor. Naked people with bags over their head were placed on crosses. Shortly after Gaahl was sent to prison and Kvitrafn left the band. In 2006 they released ""Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam"".

During October 2007, Gorgoroth members Gaahl and King ov Hell decided to kick founding member Infernus out of the band. A legal battle over the rights of the name and logo between Infernus and Gaahl / King then ensued. Gaahl and King carried on touring without Infernus for around 18 months after copyrighting the band's name and logo (before 'firing' him), while Infernus put together a new line-up. Oslo City District Court delivered a verdict on March 10th 2009 on the main question in the Gorgoroth trademark case, which took place at the end of January 2009, deciding that King ov Hell's trademark registration #243365 of the band name was not valid and shall therefore be deleted.

After the legal dispute, Gorgoroth published Quantos Possunt ad Satanitatem Trahunt with Infernus remaining the only original member and composer. In 2011, the band re-recorded the '97 full-length Under the Sign of Hell with the original vocalist Pest. In 2015, they recorded the new album Instinctus Bestialis with a new vocalist, Atterigner.

Atlanta-based post-hardcore/alternative metal act the Chariot is a showcase for singer Josh Scogin. Formerly frontman for the popular Christian nu-metallers Norma Jean (originally known as Luti-Kriss, before Dirty South rapper Ludacris eclipsed their limited popularity), Scogin left Norma Jean for undisclosed personal reasons in 2003, following the release of their second album. Largely dispensing with the rap-rock and nu-metal aspects of Norma Jean in favor of a punkier metalcore direction, Scogin almost immediately formed the Chariot with members of other area metal and CCM groups.

The original lineup of the Chariot consisted of Scogin, singer and guitarist Keller Harbin, guitarist Tony Medina, bassist Joshua Beiser, and drummer Jeff Carter. Signing to the popular Christian indie rock label Solid State Records in 2004, the band debuted later that year with the almost operatically titled Everything Is Alive, Everything Is Breathing, Nothing Is Dead and Nothing Is Bleeding. Following the subsequent release of a live DVD, Ladies and Gentlemen, the Chariot, Medina and Carter left the band; new drummer Mark Nicks debuted on the 2005 EP Unsung, but was replaced by Jake Ryan before sessions began for the band's second full-length, The Fiancee. After the album was recorded, Beiser and Harbin left the Chariot (Harbin joining Every Time I Die) and were replaced by Jon Terry and Dan Eaton in time for an extensive North American package tour with other bands from the Solid State Records roster.

Delayed by the rapid changeover in band personnel, The Fiancee eventually surfaced in early April 2007 with new bassist Jon ""KC Wolf"" Kindler on board. Terry and Eaton's time in the band would be short-lived, with the pair being replaced by Bryan Russell Taylor and Stephen Harrison before the release of the band's 2010 album, Long Live. Taylor would be the next casualty of the Chariot's revolving-door lineup, with replacement Brandon Henderson coming on board in 2011. Further lineup changes found Kindler leaving the band to attend college with Henderson and Harrison taking over bass duties in the studio. The Chariot's fifth album, One Wing, featuring production from the band's longtime engineer/producer Matt Gordon, arrived in 2012

the-cinematic-orchestra,"
                                        J Swinscoe first formed a group called Crabladder in 1990, whilst studying Fine Art at Cardiff College, releasing one official single on his own Power Tool label. In 1994, Swinscoe was given a DJ spot on Heart FM, a pirate radio station in south London.

Their debut album, Motion, was released in 1999. The critical success of that album led to them being asked to perform at the Director's Guild Awards ceremony for the presentation of the Lifetime Achievement Award to film director Stanley Kubrick.

The band were asked by the organisers of the Porto European City of Culture 2000 festival to write a new score to Dziga Vertov's classic 1929 Russian silent film Man with a Movie Camera, to be performed live in accompaniment with a showing of the film. The work differed from the band's usual compositions due to its live performance, ruling out the post production work that was present on Motion. The Cinematic Orchestra toured with the work and later released it on an album of the same name. Many of the compositions originally created for Man with a Movie Camera were later adapted from live form (adding in vocal tracks and electronic elements, among other changes) for their next album, Every Day.

The Cinematic Orchestra released the album Ma Fleur on May 7, 2007.

The Cinematic Orchestra performed the soundtrack to the Disneynature film ""The Crimson Wing: Mystery of the Flamingos"", released on December 15, 2008.

In 2010 they set up their own independent label Motion Audio.

They signed with Hopeless Records within 8 months (in April 2007) of starting the band during their senior year of high school. They then re-released their debut EP under a new name, If You Could Only Keep Me Alive, with new songs included. Over the years the band has sold over 60,000 records and over 300,000 singles.

                                        ""The Dead Weather"" didn't actually form, but more or less coalesced as a result of the creative directions in which each of its members were moving by late in 2008. From an impromptu jam, in early January 2009 at Jack White's Third Man studio in Nashville, the foursome found common ground and began writing, composing and laying down recordings 'on the fly'. The outcome was the band ""The Dead Weather "" and the album ""Horehound"", representing one of the brightest and most refreshing events in the musical history of 2009.

Alison 'VV' Mosshart, [ex ""Discount""] and still part of ""The Kills"" duo, provides lead vocals, backing guitar, percussion and her compositional style and delivery to many of the band's lyrics,

Dean Fertita, [ex ""Waxwings"" and ""Queens Of The Stone Age""] brings his multi-instrumentalist skills to bear on guitar, bass, organ, piano, synth and backing vocals.

Jack Lawrence, [ex ""Do-Whaters"" and 'floating' member of ""The Greenhornes"",  ""Blanche"" and ""The Raconteurs""] provides bass, guitar, drums and backing vocals.

Jack White, aka Jack White III, [""The White Stripes"" & ""The Raconteurs""] plays drums, provides lead and backing vocals, and plays his unmistakable style of lead guitar. Born ""John Gillis"", White began work in the upholstery trade, forming his first two-piece band ""Two Part Resin"", later renamed ""The Upholsterers"" after a career he would leave behind. He was then a member of ""Goober & The Peas"", Two-Star Tabernacle"" and ""The Henchmen"" before morphing into the persona of Jack White of ""The White Stripes"". After the success of ""The White Stripes"" as a 2-piece, with his wife Meg on drums [who's surname he adopted], White was hailed by Rolling Stone magazine as 17th in their list of ""Greatest Guitarists Of All Time"".

""The Dead Weather"" band debut was a performance at ""Third Man"" HQ in Nashville on the 11th March 2009, followed by the single ""Hang You From The Heavens"" released from the ""Horehound"" album. The album was released on 13th July 2009 in Europe and the following day in North America, with 3 tracks made available as downloads for the ""Rock Band"" video game. The 3 tracks were ""Hang You From The Heavens"", ""No Hassle Night"" and ""Treat Me Like Your Mother"". In October 2009 the band released a further single ""I Cut Like A Buffalo"", accompanied by a cover of The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band song ""A Child Of A Few Hours Is Burning To Death"". The single was also available bundled with 2 live tracks ""Bone House"" & ""Hang You From The Heavens"". During 2009 the band appeared on ""The Culture Show"" & ""Later, With Jools Holland"" on UK TV.

At the close of 2009 the band were close to completion of a follow-up album and will be touring the Pacific in March 2010, taking in Australia, New Zealand & Japan. By mid-January 2010 a documentary DVD will be available worldwide titled ""It Might Get Loud"" featuring the guitarists Jack White [""Fly Farm Blues""], Jimmy Page & The Edge.

                                        The Ghost Inside is a Los Angeles-based hardcore band. They began as a group of friends in El Segundo, CA united by their shared passion for bands in the hardcore scene. The group stands for authenticity, dedication, perseverance and the most literal adherence to the core values behind their craft. Sonically, the group places equal emphasis on deeply personal vocals, urgent riffing and pile-driving breakdowns within the framework of their heavily melodic modern hardcore.

As A Dying Dream, they released an EP, Now or Never on Frontline Records. A year later, they signed to Mediaskare Records, where they re-recorded and re-released the EP with an additional track and bonus live footage. Not long after, they changed their name to The Ghost Inside, and released a full length studio album entitled Fury and the Fallen Ones.
Their second album, titled Returners, was released on June 8, 2010 via Mediaskare Records.
On February 24, 2011, it was announced that KC Stockbridge and The Ghost Inside mutually parted ways and that Andrew Tkaczyk had been filling in on drums. Andrew was formerly the drummer and main songwriter in the band For the Fallen Dreams.[1] As of January 10, 2012, the band has been signed to Epitaph Records.[2]
Their first release for Epitaph Records Get What You Give was produced by A Day to Remember's Jeremy McKinnon[3] and debuted at No. 88 on the Billboard Top 200.[4]
In 2012, the band headlined the Alternative Press Tour along with Miss May I.
In 2013, the band toured the world with their breakthrough album, Get What You Give.
